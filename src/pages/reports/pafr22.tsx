                As the new Controller for the City of Los Angeles, our Office
                has the Charter responsibility to prepare and publish the City's
                Annual Comprehensive Financial Report (ACFR) of the City for the
                fiscal year ended June 30, 2022.
                <br />
                <br />
                We live in tumultuous times. The residents and businesses of Los
                Angeles have endured a once-in-a-century pandemic that upended
                lives and livelihoods throughout the City, falling hardest on
                the most vulnerable. Rising rents and housing prices have
                increased housing insecurity for tens of thousands of tenants
                and fueled a homelessness emergency. The impacts of the
                pandemic, inflation and international conflicts continue to
                disrupt supply chains around the world.
                <br />
                <br />
                Amid deepening economic and political divides, Los Angeles is at
                the epicenter of these and even larger challenges, including the
                "planetary red alert" of climate change. Angelenos in the last
                election voted for change. It is our responsibility to respond
                with transparency and accountability. <br />
                <br />
                The ACFR provides a report on revenues and expenses for all the
                City's funds, including the Harbor, Airports and Department of
                Water and Power and a snapshot of the fiscal condition of the
                City as it ended the fiscal year on June 30 of 2022.
                <br />
                <br />
                <ul className='list-disc pl-4'>
                  <li>
                    Total City revenues, including Governmental and
                    Business-Type activities, were approximately $20.0 billion,
                    an 8.7 percent increase over FY 2020-21.
                  </li>

                    {' '}
                    Total City expenses including Governmental and Business-Type
                    activities, were approximately $16.6 billion, a decrease of
                    4.5 percent from FY 2020-21.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The aggregate fund balances of the City's governmental funds
                    were $7.3 billion, a net increase of $857.4 million from
                    June 30, 2021.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The Reserve Fund cash balance began FY 2022-23 at $601.7
                    million or 8.1 percent of General Fund Budget, down from an
                    all-time high of $647.0 million at the beginning of Fiscal
                    Year 2021-22.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The City's bonded debt and long-term notes payable as of
                    June 30, 2022, totaled $37.3 billion, an increase of $3.1
                    billion from the prior year's balance of $34.2 billion.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The largest General Fund departmental expenditures
                    (including encumbrances) went to Police ($1.8 billion); Fire
                    ($780.2 million); and Sanitation ($330.6 million).
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <br />
                While the City is currently in a stable fiscal position,
                significant challenges lie ahead. The almost $2.0 billion in
                one-time revenue from the federal government available during
                the last two years has largely been spent. Retirement Plans'
                adverse investment returns during Fiscal Year 2021-22 will
                increase future pension costs, which now consume more than 15%
                of the General Fund budget. Increased labor costs put a further
                strain on resources to maintain and improve services to our
                residents. There is also universal recognition of the need to
                spend more to house the more than 42,000 unhoused residents of
                our community. Finally, Los Angeles has underinvested for
                decades in maintaining its capital and human infrastructure -
                which will come under intense test from the impacts of climate
                change.
                <br />
                <br />
                All this impels us to "link arms" (as Mayor Karen Bass has
                advocated) to undertake the difficult, long-term changes that
                will not only ensure financial stability, but address the urgent
                need to make Los Angeles a more equitable and sustainable city.
                We pledge that the Office of the Controller will be a
                collaborative partner in meeting those shared challenges.
                <br />
                <br />I would like to acknowledge the professional and dedicated
                staff of the Financial Analysis and Reporting Division of the
                Controller's Office for the preparation of this report. I would
                also like to express my appreciation to other staff of the
                Office for their assistance and contributions, as well as other
                professional contributors citywide.

              The Government Finance Officers Association of the United States
              and Canada (GFOA) has given an Award for Outstanding Achievement
              in Popular Annual Financial Reporting to the City of Los Angeles
              for its Popular Annual Financial Report for the fiscal year ended
              June 30, 2021. The Award for Outstanding Achievement in Popular
              Annual Financial Reporting is a prestigious national award
              recognizing conformance with the highest standards for preparation
              of state and local government popular reports.
              <br />
              To receive the award, a government unit must publish a Popular
              Annual Financial Report, whose contents conform to program
              standards of creativity, presentation, understandability, and
              reader appeal. The award is valid for a period of one year only.
              We believe our current report continues to conform to the Popular
              Annual Financial Reporting requirements, and we are submitting it
              to GFOA to determine its eligibility for another Award.

            <h2 className='mt-3'>Local Economy</h2>
            <p className='mt-2 lg:max-w-5xl'>
              The City and its surrounding metropolitan region feature
              incredible diversity in both population and the economy. Tourism
              and hospitality, professional and business services, international
              trade, entertainment production, and wholesale trade and logistics
              all contribute significantly to local employment. The Port of Los
              Angeles handles the largest volume of containerized cargo of all
              U.S. ports and ranks as number one in cargo value for U.S.
              waterborne foreign traffic. According to preliminary ACI
              statistics, in the calendar year 2021, Los Angeles International
              Airport (LAX) was the fifth busiest airport in the world in terms
              of total passengers and 8th busiest airport in the world in terms
              of total cargo metric tons.
              <br />
              <br />
              The passage of the federal American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) in
              March 2021 significantly changed City’s fiscal outlook after the
              pandemic downturn. ARPA, which provided $1.3 billion in direct
              financial assistance to the City over the last two fiscal years
              helped fill the revenue gap and eliminated the need to dip into
              the reserves to balance the books.
              <br />
              <br />
              At the beginning of fiscal year 2022, as COVID-19 vaccine became
              widely available and the economy reopened, the unemployment in the
              City of Los Angeles began its steady decline from 7.2 percent in
              October 2021 to 4.6 percent as of October 2022. With the improving
              economy throughout fiscal 2022, most economic sensitive revenue
              rebounded. The improvement in revenue along with the federal
              assistance allowed the City to close fiscal year 2022 in a strong
              financial position. While most revenue sources have remained
              stable during the earlier months of fiscal year 2023, the economic
              outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year remains uncertain.
              According to the University of California (UCLA) Anderson
              Forecast, the employment picture in California has evolved
              slightly in recent months as the three sectors of health care and
              social services, leisure and hospitality, and education have shown
              the largest gains in jobs. And despite the statewide gains in
              leisure and hospitality employment, the landscape for that sector
              remains difficult in the City of Los Angeles. Without increased
              employment gains in the hospitality and leisure sector, full
              economic recovery is expected to remain on a shallow trend. In
              addition, whether the economy slips into a recession or not
              depends largely on whether inflation continues to stay elevated,
              and any additional actions the Federal Reserve takes to bring down
              inflation.
              <br />
              <br />
              While the City is currently in a strong fiscal position,
              significant challenges lie ahead. The almost $2 billion in
              one-time revenue from the federal government available during the
              last two years is no longer available for future budgets. The City
              faces difficult decisions on how to continue the programming those
              funds made possible while simultaneously facing potential
              increased cost and lower receipts arising from the impact of
              rising interest rates.
              <br />
              <br />
              Higher mortgage interest rates have led to declining real estate
              sales volume and decreasing prices, which would impact documentary
              tax receipt, a key revenue source for the City. In its Second
              Financial Status Report issued on December 1, 2022, the Chief
              Administrative Officer reported that declining sales have already
              resulted in $23 million in documentary transfer tax receipts
              shortfall during the first four months of fiscal year 2023. Voters
              in the last election passed Measure ULA, which increases the tax
              to provide revenue. More worrisome is that sales volume is
              expected to continue to slide. According to the California
              Association of Realtors’ October 2022 forecast, sales volume is
              expected to decline by 7.2 percent and prices are expected to
              decrease by 8.8 percent in 2023. This would likely result in
              increasing monthly shortfalls and lower year-end documentary
              receipts. In addition, the increasing probability of a recession,
              the unresolved war abroad, global supply chain issues, and energy
              costs contribute to downward economic pressures which could
              negatively affect other economically sensitive revenue sources.

              financed, limiting financing only to those items with a useful
              life of six years or more. In accordance with this policy, the
              ratio of annual debt payments cannot exceed 15% of General Fund
              revenues for voter-approved and non-voter approved debt overall,
              and cannot exceed 6% of General Fund revenues for non-voter
              approved debt alone. The 6% ceiling for non-voter approved debt
              may be exceeded only if there is a guaranteed new revenue stream
              for the debt payments and the additional debt will not cause the
              ratio to exceed 7.5%, or there is no guaranteed revenue stream but
