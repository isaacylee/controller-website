The Preliminary Financial Report, made available each October after the City closes its books, is the first of such report each year. It provides information on how the City spent its money over the past fiscal year, with data and analysis of the City’s revenues and expenditures, reserves and bonded indebtedness.\n\nAlthough the last fiscal year was solid thanks to an uptick in revenue and federal assistance, numerous economic challenges remain and difficult budgeting decisions could arise next year. Scroll below to view the report summary with interactive data visualizations, followed by the full text of the report.\n\nRevenues\n\nDuring the 2021-22 fiscal year, total revenues in budgeted funds were $10.2 billion last year, a 10.4% increase over the prior year and 12.2% more than before the pandemic. View this interactive data visualization to explore the relative size of the City’s revenue sources and their growth over the past 10 years.\n\nExpenditures\n\nTotal budgeted expenditures were $9.4 billion, 5.4% higher than the year prior as spending increased across nearly every category.\nThis interactive data visualization compares the expenditures of the City’s different departments, as well as non-departmental expenditures, over the past 10 years.\n\nReserves\n\nThe Reserve Fund is established to ensure that funds are available for unanticipated expenditures and revenue shortfalls in the General Fund. The City’s Reserve Fund Policy sets a goal for the Reserve Fund to be at least 5% of the General Fund budget every year. On July 1, 2022, the Reserve Fund had a balance of $601.7 million, 8.1% of the General Fund budget and well above the 5% Reserve Fund Policy goal.\n\nThe Budget Stabilization Fund (BSF) was added to the City Charter in 2011. The purpose of the BSF is to set aside funds when the City exceeds revenue projections to help smooth out years when revenue is stagnant or in decline. In fiscal year 2022, the BSF grew slightly to $119.5 million. Click the chart below to view the performance of the Reserve Fund and Budget Stabilization Fund, both in dollar terms and as a percentage of budgeted General Fund revenues.\n\nDebt\n\nThe City’s debt management policy establishes guidelines for the structure and management of the City’s debt obligations. These guidelines include a non-voter-approved debt service cap of 6% and a total debt service cap of 15% as a percent of General Fund revenues. The City’s debt service obligations decreased to 4.65% last fiscal year.\n\nRecommendations\n\nThe City’s immediate fiscal situation is solid, but economic conditions remain unstable as cyclical COVID-19 trends, rising inflation, supply chain disruptions and international conflicts continue to impact global markets. The Controller makes the following recommendations in the Preliminary Financial Report:\n\nExercise caution when considering new spending requests.\n\nWhile most revenue streams have recovered to pre-pandemic levels, now is not the time to overspend. Before approving new spending requests, the City must first evaluate its ability to maintain neighborhood services and equity-related programming.\n\nPreserve a strong rainy day fund.\n\nIf recession occurs, local revenues will inevitably be impacted. The City should continue to build its Reserve Fund to be prepared for future emergencies.\n\nMonitor personnel and retirement spending.\n\nFuture salary increases and rising pension costs could prove unsustainable if revenues do not keep pace. The City must continue to monitor these expenditures to ensure they do not constrain its ability to expand services.\n\nCOVER LETTER\n\nOctober 26, 2022\n\nHonorable Eric Garcetti, Mayor\n\nHonorable Members of the Los Angeles City Council\n\nRe: Preliminary Financial Report for Fiscal Year 2021-22\n\nThe Controller’s Office submits the Preliminary Financial Report (PFR) each fall to review the City of Los Angeles’ financials for the prior fiscal year. Our report is the City’s primary look back at municipal finances after the close of the fiscal year, providing an overview and analysis of revenues and expenditures, reserves and bonded indebtedness. In January 2023, the Controller’s Office will follow up by issuing the Annual Comprehensive Financial Report for 2021-2022, which is prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles and audited by an independent firm of certified public accountants.\n\nAccompanying the PFR are online interactive visualizations with 10 years of data, which may be found at lacontroller.org/pfr2022. Information on special fund balances and uses, Reserve Fund starting balances over the years, and budget appropriations, adjustments, expenditures and revenues, are also on my website.\n\nWhile the report covers the previous fiscal year, it is meant to help City leaders understand and assess the health of and challenges facing the City’s finances, including the impact of recent inflation and possible economic downturn.\n\nA year of recovery\n\nThe previous fiscal year was one of recovery for the City as COVID-19 vaccines became widely available and the economy began to reopen. The City received financial assistance from the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (ARPA), accounting for an additional $640 million in revenues available for General Fund expenditures, and subsequently, City revenues rebounded to pre-pandemic levels. \n\nHighlighted in the PFR are these facts about the 2021-22 fiscal year:\n\nActual revenues in budgeted funds were $10.2 billion, a 10.4 percent increase over FY 2020-21 and 12.2 percent more than FY 2018-2019 before the pandemic. This figure does not include ARPA assistance.\nTotal expenditures (excluding encumbrances) from budgeted funds were $9.4 billion, an increase of 5.4 percent.\nThe Fiscal Year-start adjusted Reserve Fund balance was $601.7 million or 8 percent of General Fund receipts anticipated in the 2022-23 Budget, $229.4 million above the 5.0 percent Reserve Fund Policy goal. The beginning Reserve Fund balance for 2022-23 is at its second highest level for the last 10 years.\n\nConcerns remain\n\nWhile many City revenues have rebounded since the pandemic-related downturn, economic challenges remain and difficult budgeting decisions could arise next year, including: \n\nPension costs to the City increased slightly last fiscal year, totaling $1.5 billion and making up 15 percent of total spending. Future increases could be mitigated if the City can hold salary expenditures under long-term averages, but this issue should be monitored carefully.\nWhile the FY 2022-23 budget dealt with deferred wage increases and upcoming labor negotiations by allocating one-time revenues toward compensation adjustments, the City still faces potential spending increases related to pending litigation and other long-term costs. These costs could constrain the City’s ability to expand services in future years, especially if revenues do not keep pace.\nNumerous economic issues could impact City revenues, including cyclical COVID-19 trends, rising inflation, supply chain disruptions and international conflicts.\n\nTo proactively address these concerns, the City should preserve a robust Reserve Fund and Budget Stabilization Fund, and remain cautious when considering future spending requests. By exercising caution now, the City can avoid painful cuts should economic conditions deteriorate.\n\nMy staff and I appreciate the cooperation shown by City departments as we prepared this report. Should you have questions or require additional information, please contact my Director of Financial Analysis and Reporting, Wally Oyewole at rahoof.oyewole@lacity.org.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nRON GALPERIN\nL.A. Controller\n\ncc:     Chris Concepción, Chief Deputy Controller\n          Sharon Tso, Chief Legislative Analyst\n          Matt Szabo, City Administrative Officer\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nAt the close of each fiscal year, the Office of the Controller reports on the finances of the City for the year that recently closed. This Preliminary Financial Report is the first part of that reporting process and provides cash basis information on revenues, expenditures, reserves, and bonded indebtedness, including comparisons to the prior year and to the Adopted Budget (Budget).\n\nThe second part of this reporting requirement is the Annual Comprehensive Financial Report (ACFR), the City’s official, audited financial statement, which will be released later this fiscal year. Together, these two documents elucidate and inform both City decision-makers and the public on the City’s financial position.\n\nAn interactive presentation of the report is available at:\n\nhttps://lacontroller.org/pfr2022\n\nEconomic Recovery Continued\n\nTwo years ago, the City was confronted with an unprecedented challenge: the global COVID-19 pandemic. In response, the City worked expeditiously and operated in an environment of austerity to maintain core government services, protect small businesses and vulnerable groups, and more. However, in that same year, the City experienced financial challenges as economy sensitive revenues declined and emergency expenditures increased. Fiscal Year 2021-22 was a year of recovery for the City from the COVID-19 pandemic as COVID-19 vaccines became widely available and the economy began to reopen. This same Fiscal Year, the City also experienced a reversal of previous fortunes as the first tranche of financial assistance from the Federal government arrived.  This assistance, otherwise known as the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (ARPA), accounted for an additional $639.5 million in revenues available for eligible General Fund expenditures, and subsequently, the City experienced revenues rebounding to pre-pandemic levels.\n\nThe Fiscal Year 2021-22 Budget was adopted with a framework of economic improvement, and projected a strong rebound, with 7.7 percent growth in General Fund revenue, excluding the first tranche of $639.5 million ARPA funding received in May 2021. With the City experiencing recovery of most revenue sources, combined with the receipt of Federal funds, the City ended Fiscal Year 2021-22 with total General Fund revenues exceeding the Budget by $91.6 million, growing by 8.4 percent above Fiscal Year 2020-21.\n\nWhile the recovery from pandemic-era low revenue receipts occurred at such a high growth rate (12.4 percent), the revenues from transient occupancy taxes and parking-related receipts have not fully returned to levels seen before the pandemic.\n\nThe Fiscal Year 2022-23 Budget assumes the City will continue economic recovery from the pandemic-related downturn and return to a steadier state. The Budget reflects that the City will continue investing in its communities most impacted by the pandemic with enhanced perception and commitment to incorporate equity and diversity into how services are delivered, continue to invest in the mitigation of homelessness, and invest in public safety.\n\nAlthough, in general, revenues have rebounded, the economy still faces several headwinds such as cyclical COVID-19 trends that still pose health risks, a new 40-year high inflation, supply chain crises, and disruptions caused by the war abroad. The confluence of these issues threaten to slow down recovery trends, and could negatively impact the City’s revenues.\n\nWhile not yet visible in much of the economic data, particularly in the job market data, worries about a recession continue to mount. It is therefore prudent that the City preserve a robust Reserve Fund to weather any potential future economic crises without enduring a round of destabilizing cuts. The Reserve Fund started Fiscal Year 2021-22 at 8.6 percent with a record-high balance of $647.0 million. The City began the Fiscal Year 2022-23 at 8.1 percent of the General Fund Budget or $602 million. The pathway to maintaining the City’s long-term fiscal health is to abide by the City’s Financial Policies in maintaining the cumulative value of the Reserve Fund, the Budget Stabilization Fund, and the UB line item for mid-year adjustments at an amount equal to at least 10 percent of budgeted General Fund revenues. Based on the Reserve Fund balance as of July 1, 2022, the City began the Fiscal Year 2022-23 with budgetary reserves totaling 11.0 percent of budgeted General Fund revenues.\n\nThis Preliminary Financial Report is organized in four distinct sections, as stated and described below:\n\nRevenues and Expenditures: A discussion of the fiscal year ended 2021-22, including trend analysis, notable changes from prior years, and financial performance relative to the Budget;\nReserve Fund: A discussion of the current condition of the City’s Reserve Fund, and analysis of the various factors influencing that figure;\nBudget Stabilization Fund: A discussion of the Fund policy and how actual figures compare to the policy; and\nBonded Indebtedness: A statement of the City’s total bonded indebtedness and debt service requirements; as well as comparisons to City policies and legal limitations.\n\n \n\nRevenues and Expenditures\n\nActual Revenue was 0.7 percent above the Budget, growing by 10.4 percent above Fiscal Year 2020-21 and 11.2 percent over Fiscal Year 2019-20 (excluding transfers from Reserve and ARPA funds). General Fund revenue grew by 7.9 percent compared to last year and was 1.4 percent above the Budget. Almost all General Fund Revenue sources outperformed the budgeted amount. Revenue in budgeted special revenue funds increased by 16.0 percent over the prior year; however, it was 0.5 percent under the Budget due to shortfalls in Building & Safety Building Permits Enterprise Fund’s revenues, State Proposition A revenues, and a delay in Disaster Response Reimbursements. Receipts from the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (ARPA) are not included in Budgeted Revenue because the funds were not appropriated for spending in the 2021-22 Budget, and the receipts were transferred to the General Fund as cash.\n\nBoth expenditures and encumbrances increased 5.2 and 31.6 percent, respectively, from June 30, 2021 to June 30, 2022. All of the spending categories increased with the exception of Proposition A Local Transit Assistance and Human Resource Benefits.\n\nReserve Fund\n\nThe City’s Reserve Fund Policy (CF 98-0459) sets a Reserve Fund cash balance goal of at least 5.0 percent of budgeted General Fund receipts. However, the Reserve Fund started Fiscal Year 2021-22 at 8.6 percent with a record-high balance of $647.0 million, $384.5 million more than twelve months earlier. The large Reserve Fund balance resulted from a combination of a General Fund surplus transfer of ARPA funds revenue, fourth-quarter revenue growth, and reduced General Fund expenditures. Although slightly lower than Fiscal Year 2021-22 balance, the Reserve Fund began Fiscal Year 2022-23 at a healthy 8.1 percent of the General Fund Budget or $602 million.\n\nBudget Stabilization Fund\n\nThe Budget Stabilization Fund (BSF) is the City’s mechanism for accumulating excess tax revenues in growth years to mitigate shortfalls in lean years. The BSF balance on June 30, 2022, was $119.5 million.\n\nBonded Indebtedness\n\nBonded indebtedness and the City’s debt service obligations increased due to the issuance of MICLA Revenue Bonds Series 2021-C and General Obligation Bonds Series 2021-A and 2021-B. However, the debt service payments ratio to General Fund receipts decreased from 4.9 percent to 4.7 percent of General Fund revenue, and is well under the City’s 15 percent policy ceiling.\n\nThe Preliminary Financial Report focuses on the cash basis financial information of the City for 2021-22, providing information on revenues and expenditures, the Reserve Fund, the Budget Stabilization Fund, and bonded indebtedness. An interactive presentation, along with all the exhibits and schedules used in the report, is available at:\n\nhttps://lacontroller.org/pfr2022\n\nAudited financial statements, prepared in conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), will be presented in the City’s Annual Comprehensive Financial Report (ACFR) later this Fiscal Year.\n\nSECTION I: REVENUES AND EXPENDITURES\n\nActual revenues in budgeted funds for 2021-22 were $10.2 billion, an increase of 10.4 percent compared to 2020-21, and an increase of 12.2 percent over pre-pandemic 2018-19. The revenues do not include the ARPA funding and transfer from the Reserve fund.\n\nTotal expenditures (excluding encumbrances) from budgeted funds increased by 5.2 percent to $9.3 billion compared to 2020-21.  In addition to the expenditures, $679.6 million were encumbered as of June 30, 2022.\n\nExhibit 1 below shows the ten-year history of total revenues and expenditures.\n\nSince 2012-13, revenues have grown by 49.9 percent (average annual growth of 4.7 percent), while expenditures have increased by 46.2 percent (average annual growth of 4.3 percent). As seen in Exhibit 1, revenues have consistently exceeded expenditures, which has allowed the City to grow the Reserve and Budget Stabilization Funds.\n\nThe 2021-22 Budgeted revenue totaled $10.8 billion (excluding $640.1 million in available balances), of which $7.5 billion was in the General Fund, and $3.3 billion was in Special Revenue Funds. Total receipts, including transfers from Reserve and ARPA funds, for the year were $10.9 billion, 0.7 percent more than budgeted, while total expenditures (including encumbrances) were $9.9 billion, 13.4 percent less than budgeted. Detail of budgeted and actual receipts and expenditures is presented in Schedules III and IV.\n\nGeneral Fund Revenues\n\nThe General Fund is the primary operating fund of the City. It is used to account for all financial resources except those legally required to be accounted for in other funds. General Fund revenues are derived from such sources as taxes, licenses, permits, fees, fines, intergovernmental revenues, charges for services, special assessments, and interest income. Exhibit 2 presents 2021-22 actual General Fund revenues by percentage.\n\nFiscal Year 2021-22 General Fund receipts totaled $6.9 billion (excluding the transfers from Reserve and ARPA funds), $91.5 million or 1.4 percent above the Budget, $500.2 million or 7.9 percent higher than 2020-21, and $639.1 million or 10.3 percent higher than the pre-pandemic 2018-19. Over the past five years, General Fund revenue averaged 4.2 percent growth, and is now back on track after negative growth in Fiscal Year 2020-21. Exhibit 3 below compares adopted and actual General Fund receipts by fiscal year.\n\nAll General Fund revenue sources outperformed the Budget in 2021-22 except for the following: Property Taxes ($76.8 million or 3.2 percent below Budget), Licenses, Permits, Fees and Fines ($90.5 million or 7.3 percent), Power Revenue Transfer ($0.8 million or 0.4 percent), Parking Fines ($13.3 million or 10.8 percent), and Grant Receipts ($50.8 million or 55.6 percent).\n\nProperty Tax receipts were $62.1 million (2.8 percent), higher than 2020-21 receipts but lower than the budget by $76.8 million or 3.2 percent. Ex-CRA Property Tax Increment revenue was $8.5 million over the budget and $7.6 million lower than the prior year.\n\nUtility Users’ Tax was 5.5 percent above the Budget, 3.7 percent higher than last year’s actual receipts; however, it was 0.9 percent lower than pre-pandemic Fiscal Year 2018-19. While all components were above the Budget, Telephone Users Taxes experienced negative growth year over year. It was lower than last year’s receipts by $2.1 million or 1.8 percent, and lower than pre-pandemic Fiscal Year 2018-19 by $38.4 million or 25.7 percent.\n\nThe Budget assumed 4.4 percent growth for Business Tax receipts; however, actual receipts were 9.4 percent or $65.2 million higher than last year and 5.7 percent or $41.0 million over the Budget. Non-cannabis Business Tax actual receipts of $632.1 million were 14.7 percent or $81.2 million more than the Budget and 13.8 percent or $76.5 million more than last year.  Meanwhile, the Recreational Cannabis Business Tax generated $125.5 million in revenues, which was lower than the Budget by $40.2 million (24.3 percent), and lower than last year’s actual by $11.3 million (8.3 percent).\n\nSales Tax Receipts were $80.7 million or 13.3 percent above the Budget, $162.7 million or 31.0 percent more than last year, and $105.9 million or 18.2 percent more than 2018-19 receipts.\n\nFranchise Income ended higher than the Budget by $11.3 million, mainly due to Natural Gas Franchise income that exceeded the Budget by $6.1 million and Commercial and Multi-family Solid Waste Franchise Income which was above Budget by $4.9 million.\n\nLicenses, Permits, Fees and Fines ended at $90.5 million or 7.3 percent lower than the Budget, $103.3 million or 8.2 percent lower than last year’s receipts. However, if the $125.0 million in one-time COVID-19 Federal Relief fund received in prior year were excluded, 2021-22 receipts were actually higher by $21.7 million or 1.9 percent. Departmental receipts (relating mainly to licenses, permits, and various service fees collected by departments) and Emergency and Ambulance Services were above the budgeted amounts of $37.4 million and $22.0 million, respectively. However, other components such as Services to the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (LACMTA) and Services to Proprietary Departments were under budget by $30.8 million and 17.1 million, respectively. The shortfall in reimbursements from special revenue funds was $102.2 million.\n\nGrants receipts were under Budget by $50.8 million, mainly due to delayed reimbursements from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Public Assistance program for pandemic-related costs.\n\nTransient Occupancy Tax (TOT, commonly known as Hotel Tax) receipts dropped 65.4 percent by the end of Fiscal Year 2020-21 compared to pre-pandemic 2018-19 since travel and hospitality virtually stopped. However, with the reopening, the City experienced notable increases in TOT revenues.  Actual receipts were $55.8 million or 30.5 percent above the Budget and $128.7 million or 116.6 percent higher than last year. While receipts have improved significantly, they are still 25.0 percent below pre-COVID levels. Employee costs and worker shortages appears to be holding back rebound in hospitality and travel. International tourism and business travel still have a long recovery ahead.\n\nExhibit 4 shows cumulative Transient Occupancy Tax monthly receipts for FY 2019, FY 2020, FY 2021, and FY2022.\n\nDocumentary Transfer Tax grew to all-time highs during the pandemic. The actual receipts were $81.8 million or 36.0 percent above the Budget and $72.9 million or 30.9 percent above last year. The tight housing supply has driven strong price growth and increased sales volumes since the beginning of the pandemic. However, Documentary Transfer Tax receipts could take a hit in the later part of the current year or next year due to the ongoing high inflation and high interest rates threatening to slow down housing price growth and sales volume.\n\nThe Power Revenue Transfer was $0.8 million (0.4 percent) less than the Budget and $6.7 million or 3.1 percent more than last year, which was the lowest in a decade. It has declined since 2016, with a 3.1 percent average decrease over the previous five years.\n\nExhibit 5 below displays a 10-year history of General Fund receipts, excluding transfers from the Reserve Fund.\n\nAppropriations, Expenditures & Encumbrances\n\nTotal expenditures, including encumbrances, were $9.9 billion. This amount was $621.9 million or 6.7 percent higher than 2020-21 and $1.5 billion or 13.4 percent lower than the Budget.\n\nExhibit 6 below compares the Budget, the final appropriation (which includes interim appropriations made during the year), and actual expenditures and encumbrances by fiscal year.\n\nFor the last five years, total actual Expenditures and Encumbrances have grown by an average of 4.0 percent. For the same period, Salaries (excluding Library and Recreation and Parks) increased by 3.8 percent, and Services, Supplies, Equipment, and Others by 6.9 percent. Salaries are made up of Sworn and Civilian Salaries, which increased by 3.8 percent and 3.4 percent, respectively.\n\nExhibit 7 below breaks out summarized categories of budgetary and actual expenditures and encumbrances for 2020-21 and 2021-22. Detailed information by department may be found in Schedule IV.\n\nSalaries increased by $87.6 million or 2.3 percent compared to last year, mainly due to payments of deferred excess sick payouts and one-time bonuses to certain labor organization members for a portion of deferred compensation adjustments.\n\nTotal contributions to Library and Recreation and Parks increased by $13.1 million and $133.1 million, respectively. Besides regular transfers to Library and Recreation and Parks made pursuant to Charter requirements that are tied to growth in the City’s total assessed valuation, additional transfers of $95.0 million to Recreation and Parks were made from ARPA funding for projects in connection with deferred maintenance and childcare facilities.\n\nCapital Improvement Expenditure Program (CIEP) expenditures were 68.2 percent or $284.0 million lower than the Budget, and $56.2 million more than the prior year. The most significant variance was in Clean Water Projects, which was $210.4 million lower compared to Budget, but was $32.0 million more than the preceding year’s actual.\n\nHuman Resources Benefits expenses were $4.7 million or 0.6 percent below the Budget, and lower by $12.6 million or 1.6 percent compared to last year. The decrease was primarily due to decreased health care subsidies for employees, by $16.1 million or 3.0 percent, and Unemployment Insurance costs, which fell by $3.9 million.\n\nExhibit 8 below breaks out expenditures and encumbrances by Governmental Activity.\n\nAs budget priorities shifted and the economy expanded, the share of spending for the Protection of Persons and Property has remained remarkably stable at almost a third of the total expenditures.\n\nAdditionally, the contributions to the City’s pension systems totaled $1.5 billion, 15.0 percent of total spending. This amount is up slightly from the prior year. Future increases could be mitigated to the extent that the City can hold salary expenditures under long-term averages, but this issue should be monitored carefully.\n\nThe City ended the Fiscal Year with a total of $679.6 million in encumbrances:  $503.6 million in the General Fund and $176.0 million in special revenue funds, $130.8 million was encumbered for salaries to be paid in July 2022, with the balance encumbered in expense, equipment, and special revenue fund project accounts.\n\nEncumbered funds for salaries are earmarked for the fiscal year’s last pay period, and unspent funds are immediately released after payroll is made. Funds encumbered for expense accounts are continued across fiscal years to ensure that cash is available to cover the expenditure when it is made. Schedule V provides a listing of General Fund encumbrances by the department.\n\nThe General Fund Encumbrance Policy provides that encumbered funds that remain unspent for a period longer than one Fiscal Year shall be disencumbered every fiscal year, with the exception of capital project funds.  Prior-year encumbrances are automatically disencumbered unless exempted by Mayor and Council approval. As part of the 2021-22 Year-End Financial Status Report, a total of $55.9 million was exempted from this policy, an increase of $2.9 million from last year’s exemptions. As noted in past years, exceptions should be closely monitored.\n\nUnencumbered General funds revert to the Reserve Fund at year-end. As such, exemptions to the automatic disencumbrance policy reduce reversions, thereby reducing the cash available in the Reserve Fund to pay for emergencies and contingencies. Section II below discusses the status of the Reserve Fund in more detail.\n\nSECTION II: RESERVE FUND\n\nThe Reserve Fund is established to ensure that funds are available for unanticipated expenditures and revenue shortfalls in the General Fund. The Reserve Fund consists of an Emergency Account and a Contingency Account.\n\nThe Emergency Reserve Account is fixed at 2.75 percent of the adopted General Fund receipts. A finding of urgent economic necessity is required to use these funds. The Contingency Reserve Account includes all monies in the Reserve Fund over and above the amount required to be allocated to the Emergency Account. Contingency Reserve Account funds can be a source of additional funding to cover unanticipated expenses or revenue shortfalls.\n\nThe City’s Reserve Fund Policy (CF 98-0459) sets a Reserve Fund cash balance goal of at least 5.0 percent of budgeted General Fund receipts. Exhibit 9 below displays the past ten years of beginning Emergency and Contingency Reserve Fund balances compared to this policy target.\n\nThe Reserve Fund is a major indicator of the City’s fiscal health. It is vital to cash flow, bond ratings, and the ability to manage financial challenges as the City did in 2019-20 when almost $200.0 million from the Reserve Fund was used to balance the General Fund revenue shortfall.\n\nFailure to maintain the City’s Reserve Fund at an appropriate level not only exposes the City to significant risk in the event of an emergency but could also have negative financial impacts due to the increased cost of borrowing.\n\nReserve Fund Status\n\nAfter the 2021-22 accounting close, budgetary appropriations, return of advances, and reappropriations, the Fiscal Year-start adjusted Reserve Fund balance was $601.7 million or 8.08 percent of General Fund receipts anticipated in the 2022-23 Budget, $229.4 million above the 5.0 percent Reserve Fund Policy goal.\n\nExhibit 10, below, shows Adopted and Actual Beginning Reserve Fund Balances for the last ten years.\n\nThe Beginning Reserve Fund balance for 2022-23 is at its second highest level for the last ten years, after reaching the lowest in 2020-21, and is $124.2 million more than the assumed in the Fiscal Year 2022-23 Adopted Budget.\n\nAdjustments to the Reserve Fund Cash Balance\n\nAt the end of each Fiscal Year and the beginning of the next, a number of transactions are required to accurately reflect the status of the Reserve Fund through the closing of the City’s books. Exhibit 11 details the year-end and year-start adjustments to the Reserve Fund Cash Balance, comparing the Budget versus the actual.\n\nThe following are descriptions of the line item changes to the Reserve Fund listed in Exhibit 11:\n\nReserve Fund Cash Balance (June 30, 2022)\n\nAs of June 30, 2022, after closing the City’s General Ledger, the recorded Reserve Fund balance was $1.0 billion. This amount was $176.8 million more than anticipated in the 2022-23 Budget. The Reserve Fund cash balance is adjusted by the following factors to arrive at the year-end balance:\n\nBalance Before Year-End Reversions/Borrowings\n\nThe amount of cash available in the Contingency Reserve prior to adjustments for year-end reversions, unallocated revenues, and borrowings. It does not include cash in the Emergency Reserve. For 2021-22, this amount was higher than the anticipated in the Budget due to a higher than anticipated return of advances and early reversion made after the Budget was adopted.\n\nReversion of Uncommitted Balances\n\nUncommitted General Fund appropriations are reverted to the Reserve Fund at fiscal year-end. Appropriations (spending authority) granted to City departments by the Mayor and Council are committed throughout the year in the form of encumbrances and expenditures. Remaining or uncommitted balances are reverted to the Reserve Fund to the extent that there is available cash in the General Fund.\n\nIn 2021-22, the Budget estimated $380.7 million in reversions. The uncommitted balance at year-end was $667.3 million. Excluding unfunded appropriations, a total of $544.0 million reverted to the Reserve Fund. For a detailed breakdown of uncommitted balances by department, please see Schedule VII.\n\nYear-end Unallocated Revenue\n\nUnallocated revenue occurs when revenues exceed the total budget appropriation. At Fiscal Year-end, excess receipts of $65.1 million reverted to the Reserve Fund as unallocated revenue. The 2022-23 Adopted Budget anticipated $106.5 million in unallocated revenue. Actual receipts were $41.4 million less than the budgeted unallocated revenue.\n\nAdvances Under CF 21-0600-S113\n\nCouncil File 21-0600-S113 authorized the Controller to borrow from the Reserve Fund at year-end to balance departmental budgets where needed in order to facilitate the closing of the City’s General Ledger. The Controller is authorized to increase appropriations within established limits without getting itemized Mayor and Council approval, a process that would delay the closing of the City’s General Ledger. Advances were made to the department of General City Purposes, $7,459.\n\nAdvances Under Charter Section 261(i) for Unfunded Encumbrances and Expenditures\n\nUnder Charter Section 261(i), the Controller transfers funds from the Reserve Fund as a loan to any fund that becomes depleted due to tardy receipt of revenue. The 2022-23 Budget estimated $50.0 million in year-end advances. Actual advances were $55.1 million, consisting of $40.0 million in unfunded expenditures and $15.1 million in unfunded encumbrances. See Schedule VIII for a breakdown by department.\n\nUnfunded expenditures generally occur when transactions take place prior to receipt of funding (e.g., grants on a reimbursement basis) and/or due to billing delays. When the funding source reimburses the costs, departments are able to repay the advances. If funding is not available, departments may request Mayor and Council approval to write off the advances. Unfunded encumbered amounts represent a technical adjustment at year-end and are reversed at the start of the new Fiscal Year, as documented below.\n\nReserve Fund Cash Balance (2022-23 Year-Start)\n\nThe year-end Reserve Fund cash balance is not the same as the year-start cash balance for the next year. The following technical adjustments are made after the close of the prior Fiscal Year but are accounted for in determining the year-start cash balance:\n\nReturn of Advances for Unfunded Encumbrances\n\nAdvances for unfunded encumbrances are reversed at the start of the following fiscal year, as discussed above.\n\n\nTransfer to Budget\n\nThe 2022-23 Budget includes a $16,648,364 transfer from Reserve Fund to Budget, which is made by the Controller during the Fiscal Year depending on the cash condition.\n\n\nTransfer to Budget Stabilization Fund\n\nThe 2022-23 Adopted Budget transferred $72.8 million into the Budget Stabilization Fund.\n\n\nReappropriations\n\nThe 2022-23 Budget and other Council actions (C.F. 22-0600-S92, 20-0600-S83, 20-0841-S23, 21-0182-S2, 21-0540, 21-0600-S115, 21-0702-S2, 21-1028-S4, 21-1427, 22-0578, 22-0611, 22-0684, 22-0754, and 22-0875) provided that certain uncommitted balances earmarked for specific programs would be reappropriated in the subsequent year if not expended by the year-end. See Schedule VII for reappropriations by the department. Actual reappropriations of $369.9 million were $47.7 million above the estimated $322.2 million Budge\n\nSECTION III: BUDGET STABILIZATION FUND\n\nThe Budget Stabilization Fund (BSF) was added to the City’s Charter in 2011. The purpose of this fund is to set aside revenues during periods of robust economic growth or when revenue projections are exceeded to help smooth out years when revenue is stagnant or is in decline. The BSF does not have a minimum balance that must be maintained.\n\nThe June 30, 2022 BSF cash balance was $119.5 million. Exhibit 12 below displays the adopted and prior year cash balance and adjustments of the BSF. The Budget includes a deposit into the Fund in FY 2022-23.\n\nThe current BSF Policy (approved January 21, 2020) states that a budget appropriation shall be included as part of the Budget for the following fiscal year when the anticipated growth in combined receipts from seven City “economically sensitive” revenue categories (Property Tax, Utility Users Tax, Business Tax, Sales Tax, Documentary Transfer Tax, Transient Occupancy Tax, and Parking Users Tax) exceeds the growth threshold. For each five-tenths of one percent that the anticipated growth exceeds the growth threshold, the amount of the required appropriation to the BSF shall equal to five percent of the value of the anticipated excess growth. The maximum appropriation shall be equivalent to 25 percent of the value of the growth above the growth threshold. The City Council and Mayor approved the 2021-22 Average Annual Ongoing Growth Threshold of 3.6 percent on March 2022, calculated pursuant to the policy (CF 21-0600-S112). The anticipated excess growth calculated per policy to be transferred to BSF is $72.8 million.\n\nThe required deposit to the BSF may be entirely forgone if the City Council and Mayor declare a fiscal emergency or suspend the BSF funding policy based on findings that it is in the City’s best interest to suspend the policy. Mid-year deposits to the BSF or deposits above the required amount may be authorized by the City Council, subject to the approval of the Mayor, at any time during the year from various General Fund sources. Consideration should be given to depositing unanticipated and unbudgeted receipts that are not otherwise required to balance the current year budget.\n\nSECTION IV: BONDED INDEBTEDNESS\n\nThe City’s Debt Management Policy creates guidelines for the structure and management of the City’s debt obligations. These guidelines include target and ceiling levels for certain debt ratios to be used for planning purposes. The two most significant ratios are a non-voter-approved debt service cap as a percent of General Fund revenues of 6 percent and a total debt service cap as a percent of General Fund revenues of 15 percent.\n\nExhibit 13, below, illustrates the City’s compliance with these debt management policies for the past five years.\n\nThe actual ratio of Debt Service to General Fund Receipts (excluding the ARPA transfer of $639.5 million) was 4.65 percent in 2021-22, comprised of 2.96 percent for non-voter approved debt and 1.69 percent for voter-approved debt. Even though the debt service requirements increased by 3.4 percent, the debt ratio decreased because the General Fund receipts increased at higher rate of 9.2 percent. Schedule IX shows the details of Outstanding General Obligation Bonded Debt.\n\nExhibit 13 above shows the responsibility the City has exhibited when it comes to debt management. Good administration of debt service obligations has put the City in a position to consider major projects and make strategic financing agreements available when these present financial advantages.\n\nThis significant debt capacity also indicates an opportunity to invest in large-scale, long-term infrastructure projects, including facility repair and replacement and new projects designed to stimulate economic development. Such an investment would also provide an opportunity to focus on regional equity, focusing investment in areas of the City which have often been left behind in prior initiatives.\n\nSCHEDULES I - V\n\n \n\nSCHEDULE I: CASH CONDITION STATEMENT OF RECEIPTS AND DISBURSEMENTS\n\n \n\n \n\nSCHEDULE II: RESERVE FUND STATEMENT OF RECEIPTS AND DISBURSEMENTS\n\n \n\n \n\nSCHEDULE III: STATEMENT OF RECEIPTS – BUDGET AND ACTUAL (CASH BASIS) – ALL ANNUALLY BUDGETED FUNDS\n\n \n\n \n\nSCHEDULE IV: STATEMENT OF BUDGET APPROPRIATIONS, EXPENDITURES AND ENCUMBRANCES BUDGET AND ACTUAL (CASH-BASIS) – ALL ANNUALLY BUDGETED FUNDS\n\n \n\nSCHEDULE V: YEAR-END ENCUMBRANCES – GENERAL FUND\n\n \n\nSCHEDULES VI - X\nSCHEDULE VI: GENERAL FUND UNENCUMBERED BALANCES REVERTED TO THE RESERVE FUND\n\n \n\nSCHEDULE VII: GENERAL FUND YEAR-END UNCOMMITTED BALANCES AND ADOPTED BUDGET REAPPROPRIATIONS\n\n \n\n \n\nSCHEDULE VIII: YEAR-END ADVANCES FROM THE RESERVE FUND FOR UNFUNDED EXPENDITURES AND ENCUMBRANCES\n\n \n\nSCHEDULE IX: STATEMENT OF GENERAL OBLIGATION BONDED DEBT\n\n \n\n \n\nSCHEDULE X: RATIO OF DEBT SERVICE REQUIREMENT TO GENERAL FUND RECEIPTS LAST TEN FISCAL YEARS\n\n ",

The City received financial assistance from the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (ARPA), accounting for an additional $640 million in revenues available for General Fund expenditures, and subsequently, City revenues rebounded to pre-pandemic levels.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Highlighted in the PFR are these facts about the 2021-22 fiscal year:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Actual revenues in budgeted funds were $10.2 billion, a 10.4 percent increase over FY 2020-21 and 12.2 percent more than FY 2018-2019 before the pandemic. This figure does not include ARPA assistance.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Total expenditures (excluding encumbrances) from budgeted funds were $9.4 billion, an increase of 5.4 percent.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Fiscal Year-start adjusted Reserve Fund balance was $601.7 million or 8 percent of General Fund receipts anticipated in the 2022-23 Budget, $229.4 million above the 5.0 percent Reserve Fund Policy goal. The beginning Reserve Fund balance for 2022-23 is at its second highest level for the last 10 years.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Concerns remain</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While many City revenues have rebounded since the pandemic-related downturn, economic challenges remain and difficult budgeting decisions could arise next year, including:&nbsp;</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pension costs to the City increased slightly last fiscal year, totaling $1.5 billion and making up 15 percent of total spending. Future increases could be mitigated if the City can hold salary expenditures under long-term averages, but this issue should be monitored carefully.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the FY 2022-23 budget dealt with deferred wage increases and upcoming labor negotiations by allocating one-time revenues toward compensation adjustments, the City still faces potential spending increases related to pending litigation and other long-term costs. These costs could constrain the City’s ability to expand services in future years, especially if revenues do not keep pace.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Numerous economic issues could impact City revenues, including cyclical COVID-19 trends, rising inflation, supply chain disruptions and international conflicts.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To proactively address these concerns, the City should preserve a robust Reserve Fund and Budget Stabilization Fund, and remain cautious when considering future spending requests. By exercising caution now, the City can avoid painful cuts should economic conditions deteriorate.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My staff and I appreciate the cooperation shown by City departments as we prepared this report.

This Preliminary Financial Report is the first part of that reporting process and provides cash basis information on revenues, expenditures, reserves, and bonded indebtedness, including comparisons to the prior year and to the Adopted Budget (Budget).</p>\n<p>The second part of this reporting requirement is the Annual Comprehensive Financial Report (ACFR), the City’s official, audited financial statement, which will be released later this fiscal year. Together, these two documents elucidate and inform both City decision-makers and the public on the City’s financial position.</p>\n<p>An interactive presentation of the report is available at:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://lacontroller.org/pfr2022\">https://lacontroller.org/pfr2022</a></p>\n<p><strong>Economic Recovery Continued</strong></p>\n<p>Two years ago, the City was confronted with an unprecedented challenge: the global COVID-19 pandemic. In response, the City worked expeditiously and operated in an environment of austerity to maintain core government services, protect small businesses and vulnerable groups, and more. However, in that same year, the City experienced financial challenges as economy sensitive revenues declined and emergency expenditures increased. Fiscal Year 2021-22 was a year of recovery for the City from the COVID-19 pandemic as COVID-19 vaccines became widely available and the economy began to reopen. This same Fiscal Year, the City also experienced a reversal of previous fortunes as the first tranche of financial assistance from the Federal government arrived. &nbsp;This assistance, otherwise known as the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (ARPA), accounted for an additional $639.5 million in revenues available for eligible General Fund expenditures, and subsequently, the City experienced revenues rebounding to pre-pandemic levels.</p>\n<p>The Fiscal Year 2021-22 Budget was adopted with a framework of economic improvement, and projected a strong rebound, with 7.7 percent growth in General Fund revenue, excluding the first tranche of $639.5 million ARPA funding received in May 2021. With the City experiencing recovery of most revenue sources, combined with the receipt of Federal funds, the City ended Fiscal Year 2021-22 with total General Fund revenues exceeding the Budget by $91.6 million, growing by 8.4 percent above Fiscal Year 2020-21.</p>\n<p>While the recovery from pandemic-era low revenue receipts occurred at such a high growth rate (12.4 percent), the revenues from transient occupancy taxes and parking-related receipts have not fully returned to levels seen before the pandemic.</p>\n<p>The Fiscal Year 2022-23 Budget assumes the City will continue economic recovery from the pandemic-related downturn and return to a steadier state. The Budget reflects that the City will continue investing in its communities most impacted by the pandemic with enhanced perception and commitment to incorporate equity and diversity into how services are delivered, continue to invest in the mitigation of homelessness, and invest in public safety.</p>\n<p>Although, in general, revenues have rebounded, the economy still faces several headwinds such as cyclical COVID-19 trends that still pose health risks, a new 40-year high inflation, supply chain crises, and disruptions caused by the war abroad. The confluence of these issues threaten to slow down recovery trends, and could negatively impact the City’s revenues.</p>\n<p>While not yet visible in much of the economic data, particularly in the job market data, worries about a recession continue to mount. It is therefore prudent that the City preserve a robust Reserve Fund to weather any potential future economic crises without enduring a round of destabilizing cuts. The Reserve Fund started Fiscal Year 2021-22 at 8.6 percent with a record-high balance of $647.0 million. The City began the Fiscal Year 2022-23 at 8.1 percent of the General Fund Budget or $602 million. The pathway to maintaining the City’s long-term fiscal health is to abide by the City’s Financial Policies in maintaining the cumulative value of the Reserve Fund, the Budget Stabilization Fund, and the UB line item for mid-year adjustments at an amount equal to at least 10 percent of budgeted General Fund revenues. Based on the Reserve Fund balance as of July 1, 2022, the City began the Fiscal Year 2022-23 with budgetary reserves totaling 11.0 percent of budgeted General Fund revenues.</p>\n<p>This Preliminary Financial Report is organized in four distinct sections, as stated and described below:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong><u>Revenues and Expenditures</u></strong>: A discussion of the fiscal year ended 2021-22, including trend analysis, notable changes from prior years, and financial performance relative to the Budget;</li>\n<li><strong><u>Reserve Fund</u></strong><u>:</u> A discussion of the current condition of the City’s Reserve Fund, and analysis of the various factors influencing that figure;</li>\n<li><strong><u>Budget Stabilization Fund</u></strong>: A discussion of the Fund policy and how actual figures compare to the policy; and</li>\n<li><strong><u>Bonded Indebtedness</u></strong>: A statement of the City’s total bonded indebtedness and debt service requirements; as well as comparisons to City policies and legal limitations.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong><u>Revenues and Expenditures</u></strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Actual Revenue was 0.7 percent above the Budget, growing by 10.4 percent above Fiscal Year 2020-21 and 11.2 percent over Fiscal Year 2019-20 (excluding transfers from Reserve and ARPA funds). General Fund revenue grew by 7.9 percent compared to last year and was 1.4 percent above the Budget. Almost all General Fund Revenue sources outperformed the budgeted amount. Revenue in budgeted special revenue funds increased by 16.0 percent over the prior year; however, it was 0.5 percent under the Budget due to shortfalls in Building &amp; Safety Building Permits Enterprise Fund’s revenues, State Proposition A revenues, and a delay in Disaster Response Reimbursements. Receipts from the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (ARPA) are not included in Budgeted Revenue because the funds were not appropriated for spending in the 2021-22 Budget, and the receipts were transferred to the General Fund as cash.</p>\n<p>Both expenditures and encumbrances increased 5.2 and 31.6 percent, respectively, from June 30, 2021 to June 30, 2022. All of the spending categories increased with the exception of Proposition A Local Transit Assistance and Human Resource Benefits.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong><u>Reserve Fund</u></strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>The City’s Reserve Fund Policy (CF 98-0459) sets a Reserve Fund cash balance goal of at least 5.0 percent of budgeted General Fund receipts. However, the Reserve Fund started Fiscal Year 2021-22 at 8.6 percent with a record-high balance of $647.0 million, $384.5 million more than twelve months earlier. The large Reserve Fund balance resulted from a combination of a General Fund surplus transfer of ARPA funds revenue, fourth-quarter revenue growth, and reduced General Fund expenditures. Although slightly lower than Fiscal Year 2021-22 balance, the Reserve Fund began Fiscal Year 2022-23 at a healthy 8.1 percent of the General Fund Budget or $602 million.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><strong><u>Budget Stabilization Fund</u></strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>The Budget Stabilization Fund (BSF) is the City’s mechanism for accumulating excess tax revenues in growth years to mitigate shortfalls in lean years.

This amount is up slightly from the prior year. Future increases could be mitigated to the extent that the City can hold salary expenditures under long-term averages, but this issue should be monitored carefully.</p>\n<p>The City ended the Fiscal Year with a total of $679.6 million in encumbrances:&nbsp; $503.6 million in the General Fund and $176.0 million in special revenue funds, $130.8 million was encumbered for salaries to be paid in July 2022, with the balance encumbered in expense, equipment, and special revenue fund project accounts.</p>\n<p>Encumbered funds for salaries are earmarked for the fiscal year’s last pay period, and unspent funds are immediately released after payroll is made. Funds encumbered for expense accounts are continued across fiscal years to ensure that cash is available to cover the expenditure when it is made. Schedule V provides a listing of General Fund encumbrances by the department.</p>\n<p>The General Fund Encumbrance Policy provides that encumbered funds that remain unspent for a period longer than one Fiscal Year shall be disencumbered every fiscal year, with the exception of capital project funds.&nbsp; Prior-year encumbrances are automatically disencumbered unless exempted by Mayor and Council approval. As part of the 2021-22 Year-End Financial Status Report, a total of $55.9 million was exempted from this policy, an increase of $2.9 million from last year’s exemptions. As noted in past years, exceptions should be closely monitored.</p>\n<p>Unencumbered General funds revert to the Reserve Fund at year-end. As such, exemptions to the automatic disencumbrance policy reduce reversions, thereby reducing the cash available in the Reserve Fund to pay for emergencies and contingencies.

A finding of urgent economic necessity is required to use these funds.

This amount was $176.8 million more than anticipated in the 2022-23 Budget. The Reserve Fund cash balance is adjusted by the following factors to arrive at the year-end balance:</p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-position: initial; list-style-image: initial;\">\n<li><u><u><u><u>Balance Before Year-End Reversions/Borrowings</u></u></u></u></li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">The amount of cash available in the Contingency Reserve prior to adjustments for year-end reversions, unallocated revenues, and borrowings. It does not include cash in the Emergency Reserve. For 2021-22, this amount was higher than the anticipated in the Budget due to a higher than anticipated return of advances and early reversion made after the Budget was adopted.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><u><u><u><u>Reversion of Uncommitted Balances</u></u></u></u></li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">Uncommitted General Fund appropriations are reverted to the Reserve Fund at fiscal year-end. Appropriations (spending authority) granted to City departments by the Mayor and Council are committed throughout the year in the form of encumbrances and expenditures. Remaining or uncommitted balances are reverted to the Reserve Fund to the extent that there is available cash in the General Fund.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">In 2021-22, the Budget estimated $380.7 million in reversions. The uncommitted balance at year-end was $667.3 million. Excluding unfunded appropriations, a total of $544.0 million reverted to the Reserve Fund. For a detailed breakdown of uncommitted balances by department, please see Schedule VII.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><u><u><u><u>Year-end Unallocated Revenue</u></u></u></u></li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">Unallocated revenue occurs when revenues exceed the total budget appropriation. At Fiscal Year-end, excess receipts of $65.1 million reverted to the Reserve Fund as unallocated revenue. The 2022-23 Adopted Budget anticipated $106.5 million in unallocated revenue. Actual receipts were $41.4 million less than the budgeted unallocated revenue.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><u><u><u><u>Advances Under CF 21-0600-S113</u></u></u></u></li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">Council File 21-0600-S113 authorized the Controller to borrow from the Reserve Fund at year-end to balance departmental budgets where needed in order to facilitate the closing of the City’s General Ledger. The Controller is authorized to increase appropriations within established limits without getting itemized Mayor and Council approval, a process that would delay the closing of the City’s General Ledger. Advances were made to the department of General City Purposes, $7,459.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><u><u><u><u>Advances Under Charter Section 261(i) for Unfunded Encumbrances and Expenditures</u></u></u></u></li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">Under Charter Section 261(i), the Controller transfers funds from the Reserve Fund as a loan to any fund that becomes depleted due to tardy receipt of revenue. The 2022-23 Budget estimated $50.0 million in year-end advances. Actual advances were $55.1 million, consisting of $40.0 million in unfunded expenditures and $15.1 million in unfunded encumbrances. See Schedule VIII for a breakdown by department.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">Unfunded expenditures generally occur when transactions take place prior to receipt of funding (e.g., grants on a reimbursement basis) and/or due to billing delays. When the funding source reimburses the costs, departments are able to repay the advances. If funding is not available, departments may request Mayor and Council approval to write off the advances. Unfunded encumbered amounts represent a technical adjustment at year-end and are reversed at the start of the new Fiscal Year, as documented below.</p>\n<p><strong><u>Reserve Fund Cash Balance (2022-23 Year-Start)</u></strong></p>\n<p>The year-end Reserve Fund cash balance is not the same as the year-start cash balance for the next year. The following technical adjustments are made after the close of the prior Fiscal Year but are accounted for in determining the year-start cash balance:</p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-position: initial; list-style-image: initial;\">\n<li><u><u>Return of Advances for Unfunded Encumbrances</u></u></li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">Advances for unfunded encumbrances are reversed at the start of the following fiscal year, as discussed above.<u><br>\n</u></p>\n<ul>\n<li><u></u><u><u><u>Transfer to Budget</u></u></u></li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">The 2022-23 Budget includes a $16,648,364 transfer from Reserve Fund to Budget, which is made by the Controller during the Fiscal Year depending on the cash condition.<u><br>\n</u></p>\n<ul>\n<li><u></u><u><u><u>Transfer to Budget Stabilization Fund</u></u></u></li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">The 2022-23 Adopted Budget transferred $72.8 million into the Budget Stabilization Fund.<u><br>\n</u></p>\n<ul>\n<li><u><u><u>Reappropriations</u></u></u></li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><u></u>The 2022-23 Budget and other Council actions (C.F. 22-0600-S92, 20-0600-S83, 20-0841-S23, 21-0182-S2, 21-0540, 21-0600-S115, 21-0702-S2, 21-1028-S4, 21-1427, 22-0578, 22-0611, 22-0684, 22-0754, and 22-0875) provided that certain uncommitted balances earmarked for specific programs would be reappropriated in the subsequent year if not expended by the year-end.

For each five-tenths of one percent that the anticipated growth exceeds the growth threshold, the amount of the required appropriation to the BSF shall equal to five percent of the value of the anticipated excess growth. The maximum appropriation shall be equivalent to 25 percent of the value of the growth above the growth threshold. The City Council and Mayor approved the 2021-22 Average Annual Ongoing Growth Threshold of 3.6 percent on March 2022, calculated pursuant to the policy (CF 21-0600-S112). The anticipated excess growth calculated per policy to be transferred to BSF is $72.8 million.</p>\n<p>The required deposit to the BSF may be entirely forgone if the City Council and Mayor declare a fiscal emergency or suspend the BSF funding policy based on findings that it is in the City’s best interest to suspend the policy. Mid-year deposits to the BSF or deposits above the required amount may be authorized by the City Council, subject to the approval of the Mayor, at any time during the year from various General Fund sources.

    "textofpage": "On March 1, 2022, the Controller’s office issued the Revenue Forecast Report for Fiscal Years 2022-2023, which warned that increased expenses coupled with the loss of one-time federal pandemic dollars spells trouble for the next fiscal year’s budget. The facts brought to light underscore the importance of this report, which covers the City’s 621 special purpose funds (special funds). Special funds represent approximately $4.59 billion, or 36 percent, of the City’s entire cash balance. These funds are created by ordinance and City Council action to pay for specific purposes or projects, including grant programs, capital projects, fee-supported activities, debt service and more.\n\nDuring the pandemic, the City borrowed $200 million from its special funds to soften the pandemic’s strain on the General Fund and pay for urgent COVID-19 expenses. The loans were later repaid using federal assistance funds. Because the City will be tight on funds in the next fiscal year, it is even more important to maximize the use of special funds now so that the City can maintain programs and services as much as possible.\n\nGeneral Fund vs. Special Funds\n\nDepicted in the visual below, the annual General Fund cash balance increased over time by 5.2 percent compared to 2014. Over that same period, special fund cash balances grew by an annual average of 4.5 percent. Although revenues and expenditures have increased in the General Fund and special funds, only General Fund cash reverts to the Reserve Fund at the end of each fiscal year. Uncommitted special funds and unspent encumbrances from prior years remain in their funds until expended. Use the drop down menu to toggle between General Fund and special fund views.\n\nOVERVIEW AND IDLE FUNDS\n\nThis report is guided by the City’s experience over the past two years. From March 2020 to June 30, 2021, the City of L.A.’s COVID-19 expenditures were $729.9 million. Offsetting these costs were Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) reimbursements of $39 million, and the federal Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) in the amount of $694.4 million.\n\nAt the time of the preparation of this report, City departments have spent more than $1.1 billion on programs, supplies, homeless housing, regular and overtime staff hours, emergency rental assistance, testing and vaccination efforts.\n\nOf that amount spent, $200 million was borrowed from various special funds to front the cash needed by City departments to pay for immediate COVID-19 expenses. These loans were repaid using federal financial assistance funding from the CARES Act and the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) received in 2020 and 2021.\n\nBy the end of fiscal year 2021, four new special funds were created to account for various COVID-19 spending programs. These funds had a combined cash balance of $716.8 million on June 30, 2021.\n\nBelow is more detailed information about special funds, followed by recommendations on what to do to maximize their use today.\n\nRevenue\n\nAlthough special fund revenue has increased annually by an average of 6.7 percent over the past seven years, in fiscal year 2021 revenue increased by 5.9 percent. The Housing and Homelessness function and Debt Service revenues contributed greatly to this, with an increase of 46.5 percent and 44.5 percent respectively. Federal funding for the Economic Development function also added to the rise.\n\nExpenditures\n\nAverage annual special fund expenditures grew by 6.9 percent. Expenditures in 2021 were 18.4 percent higher than in 2020. The largest jump was in the form of pandemic spending in the Economic Development function by 588.6 percent.\n\nCash Balance\n\nAlthough the average annual cash balance was 4.1 percent, the 2021 cash balance decreased by 5.7 percent as a result of Special Fund expenditures of $6.41 billion exceeding $6.09 billion in revenues. Primarily, the decrease was from City COVID-19 special fund expenditures in the amount of $846.6 million.\n\nOngoing State of Idle Special Funds\n\nIdle special funds are hereafter defined as funds which have had no spending for more than two years. In 2018, this office released a list of 123 special funds with a combined balance of $28 million that sat dormant (C.F. 18-0270). As a result of this office’s work with the Budget and Finance Committee and through CAO recommendations that were adopted by the City Council, a significant amount of idle special funds were addressed. Since the 2018 report, 63 special funds were closed and seven became active. However, 134 special funds have been added to the list as they have hit the two-year inactivity threshold, for a current total of 187 idle special funds with a total cash balance of $54.9 million.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS\n\nThe City still faces fiscal uncertainty in 2021 due to the evolving status of the coronavirus pandemic and its effects on the economy. Further, the lack of once available one-time funding from the federal government will leave gaps of funding for important City programs. However, this is an opportune time for the City to take inventory of special funds and how they can be maximized. As such, we make the following recommendations:\n\nContinue leveraging special funds to relieve the burden on the General Fund.\nInstruct the City Administrative Officer (CAO) to work with relevant departments to report on how special funds could be used to assist with or complement General Funded public safety issues and social or economic development programs.\nIdentify creative ways to expand the use of special funds.\nInstruct the CAO and relevant departments, with the assistance of the City Attorney, to analyze their special funds and report on the feasibility of expanding the use of the fund by changing the original language establishing the Special Fund.\nImprove the City’s accountability and management of special funds.\nRequest the City Attorney to draft an ordinance to repeal previously closed special funds (listed in Schedule 6) so that their corresponding ordinances can be removed from the Administrative Code.\nRequest the City Attorney, with the assistance of the CAO, to identify whether interest earnings from new special funds can legally first go towards the General Fund and to subsequently, provide the steps necessary to implement this potential change, if legally allowable.\nInstruct the CAO to develop a policy to automatically disencumber outstanding special fund encumbrances three years or older.\nRequest the City Attorney to incorporate a sunset clause for new special fund ordinances.\nInstruct the CAO to create a Departmental Special Fund Creation Form and require Departments to submit this form to summarize the intent and nature of the new special fund being requested.\nInstruct the CAO to establish a policy that allows the removal of old and obsolete grant idle special funds, especially when there is insufficient documentation available to keep them.\nInstruct the CAO and relevant Departments, with the assistance of the City Attorney, to report on the item found under the Additional Actions to Consider column listed for each idle special fund in Schedule 8.\nInstruct the CAO to evaluate the recommendations in this report and to report back on which should be included in the City’s financial policies.\nLIST OF SPECIAL FUNDS\n\nClick to view a list of the City’s special funds.\n\nDOWNLOAD THE DATA\n\nClick to download the City’s special fund data on the Controller’s Open Data portal.",

The facts brought to light underscore the importance of this report, which covers the City’s 621 special purpose funds (special funds). Special funds represent approximately $4.59 billion, or 36 percent, of the City’s entire cash balance. These funds are created by ordinance and City Council action to pay for specific purposes or projects, including grant programs, capital projects, fee-supported activities, debt service and more.</p>\n<p>During the pandemic, the City borrowed $200 million from its special funds to soften the pandemic’s strain on the General Fund and pay for urgent COVID-19 expenses. The loans were later repaid using federal assistance funds. Because the City will be tight on funds in the next fiscal year, it is even more important to maximize the use of special funds now so that the City can maintain programs and services as much as possible.</p>\n<h2>General Fund vs. Special Funds</h2>\n<p>Depicted in the visual below, the annual General Fund cash balance increased over time by 5.2 percent compared to 2014. Over that same period, special fund cash balances grew by an annual average of 4.5 percent. Although revenues and expenditures have increased in the General Fund and special funds, only General Fund cash reverts to the Reserve Fund at the end of each fiscal year. Uncommitted special funds and unspent encumbrances from prior years remain in their funds until expended.

From March 2020 to June 30, 2021, the City of L.A.’s COVID-19 expenditures were $729.9 million. Offsetting these costs were Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) reimbursements of $39 million, and the federal Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) in the amount of $694.4 million.</p>\n<p>At the time of the preparation of this report, City departments have spent more than $1.1 billion on programs, supplies, homeless housing, regular and overtime staff hours, emergency rental assistance, testing and vaccination efforts.</p>\n<p>Of that amount spent, $200 million was borrowed from various special funds to front the cash needed by City departments to pay for immediate COVID-19 expenses. These loans were repaid using federal financial assistance funding from the CARES Act and the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) received in 2020 and 2021.</p>\n<p>By the end of fiscal year 2021, four new special funds were created to account for various COVID-19 spending programs. These funds had a combined cash balance of $716.8 million on June 30, 2021.</p>\n<p>Below is more detailed information about special funds, followed by recommendations on what to do to maximize their use today.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong><u>Revenue</u></strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Although special fund revenue has increased annually by an average of 6.7 percent over the past seven years, in fiscal year 2021 revenue increased by 5.9 percent. The Housing and Homelessness function and Debt Service revenues contributed greatly to this, with an increase of 46.5 percent and 44.5 percent respectively. Federal funding for the Economic Development function also added to the rise.</p>\n<div id=\"viz1646955665832\" class=\"tableauPlaceholder\" style=\"position: relative; width: 100%; height: 727px; overflow: hidden; display: block;\"><script src=\"https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js\"></script><object class=\"tableauViz\" style=\"display: none; width: 100%; height: 727px;\" width=\"300\" height=\"150\"><param name=\"host_url\" value=\"https%3A%2F%2Fpublic.tableau.com%2F\"><param name=\"embed_code_version\" value=\"3\"><param name=\"site_root\" value=\"\"><param name=\"name\" value=\"SpecialFunds2022/RevenuesHistory\"><param name=\"tabs\" value=\"no\"><param name=\"toolbar\" value=\"yes\"><param name=\"animate_transition\" value=\"yes\"><param name=\"display_static_image\" value=\"yes\"><param name=\"display_spinner\" value=\"yes\"><param name=\"display_overlay\" value=\"yes\"><param name=\"display_count\" value=\"yes\"><param name=\"language\" value=\"en-US\"><param name=\"filter\" value=\"publish=yes\"></object><div style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;right:0;bottom:0;border:0;padding:0;margin:0\"><div style=\"top:100px;left:0;right:0;position:absolute;z-index:991;box-shadow:none;display:flex;justify-content:center;\"><style>#tableau-svg-spinner-container-2{width:65px;height:65px;border-radius:10px;display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center}#tableau-svg-spinner-2{width:50px;height:50px;-webkit-animation:tableau-svg-spinner-animation 1s linear infinite;animation:tableau-svg-spinner-animation 1s linear infinite}@-webkit-keyframes tableau-svg-spinner-animation{100%{-webkit-transform:rotate(360deg)}}@keyframes tableau-svg-spinner-animation{100%{transform:rotate(360deg)}}</style><div id=\"tableau-svg-spinner-container-2\"><svg id=\"tableau-svg-spinner-2\" viewBox=\"0 0 50 50\"><style>#tail{fill:url(#tableau-fade-2)}#head{fill:#616570}stop{stop-color:#616570}</style><linearGradient id=\"tableau-fade-2\" x2=\"50\" y1=\"25\" y2=\"25\" gradientUnits=\"userSpaceOnUse\"><stop offset=\"0\" stop-opacity=\"0\"></stop><stop offset=\".15\" stop-opacity=\".04\"></stop><stop offset=\".3\" stop-opacity=\".16\"></stop><stop offset=\".45\" stop-opacity=\".36\"></stop><stop offset=\".61\" stop-opacity=\".64\"></stop><stop offset=\".76\"></stop></linearGradient><path id=\"head\" d=\"M0 25a25 25 0 1 0 50 0h-3.9a21.1 21.1 0 1 1-42.2 0\"></path><path id=\"tail\" d=\"M50 25a25 25 0 0 0-50 0h3.9a21.1 21.1 0 1 1 42.2 0\"></path></svg></div></div><div style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;right:0;bottom:0;z-index:990;background-color:#EBEBEB;opacity:.24\"></div></div><iframe frameborder=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" title=\"데이터 비주얼리제이션\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" class=\"tableauViz\" style=\"display: block; width: 100%; height: 727px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: none;\" width=\"300\" height=\"150\"></iframe></div>\n<p><script type=\"text/javascript\">                    var divElement = document.getElementById('viz1646955665832');                    var vizElement = divElement.getElementsByTagName('object')[0];                    if ( divElement.offsetWidth > 800 ) { vizElement.style.width='100%';vizElement.style.height=(divElement.offsetWidth*0.75)+'px';} else if ( divElement.offsetWidth > 500 ) { vizElement.style.width='100%';vizElement.style.height=(divElement.offsetWidth*0.75)+'px';} else { vizElement.style.width='100%';vizElement.style.height='727px';}                     var scriptElement = document.createElement('script');                    scriptElement.src = 'https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js';                    vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement);                </script></p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong><u>Expenditures</u></strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Average annual special fund expenditures grew by 6.9 percent.

As a result of this office’s work with the Budget and Finance Committee and through CAO recommendations that were adopted by the City Council, a significant amount of idle special funds were addressed. Since the 2018 report, 63 special funds were closed and seven became active.

Although forecasts inherently involve uncertainty, this report offers estimates based on the available information and seeks to promote responsible budgeting in the year ahead. Also included in the report are the estimated requirements for debt service and General Fund cash flow borrowing.\n\nUse the dashboard below to explore actual receipts for last year, FY 21, projected revenues and their sources for FY 22 and 23, and compare last year’s revenues to the estimates for this and next fiscal year.\n\nRevenue\nFY 22\n\nThe City’s adopted budget this fiscal year, FY 22, totals $11.48 billion. Two-thirds of that, $7.5 billion, consists of General Fund revenues, while the rest, close to $3.98 billion, comes from numerous special purpose funds and available balances. Our updated estimate of General Fund receipts for the current fiscal year is $7.55 billion, 0.6% more than the budgeted amount and 7.1% above the last fiscal year. The General Fund is projected to end the fiscal year with a $42 million revenue surplus. Transient occupancy tax revenues will increase by 97% over last fiscal year, parking occupancy tax revenues will increase by 73%, sales tax revenues will increase by 24% and documentary transfer tax receipts will rise by 22%. Utility user’s tax receipts continue to fall this fiscal year by 4%, and revenues from licenses, permits, fees and fines will fall by 3.5%.\n\nFY 23\n\nWhile the economy is continuing to recover from the ongoing public health crisis, my office is cautiously optimistic that the direct economic impacts of the pandemic — business closures, event cancellations and travel restrictions — will be largely absent in FY 23. Although it is possible that anti-inflation actions by the Federal Reserve could influence revenues to some degree, any economic slowdown would likely impact FY 24 revenues more than FY 23.\n\nGeneral Fund receipts for FY 23 are projected to be $7.09 billion, which is 6.1% less than the current year estimates and 5.6% under the budgeted amount. This drop will be attributable to the loss of one-time American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) funds, which will all be received by the City this year, FY 22. However, adjusting for this inevitability, General Fund revenue growth will be approximately 3.9%.\n\nThis chart breaks down total City revenues in all categories (General Fund and special funds) from 2011 to 2021, along with revenue projections for this fiscal year and the next. Filter by category or by name of revenue source.\n\nAlthough the economy should continue to bounce back, the loss of ARPA funds spells trouble for next fiscal year’s budget. This concern is compounded by the fact that the extraordinary growth in transient occupancy, parking occupancy, sales and documentary transfer tax receipts will likely stabilize in the coming fiscal year, while property and business tax growth will remain moderate at around 4%.\n\nExpenses are also on track to increase considerably next fiscal year. The hundreds of millions of dollars in one-time ARPA funding used to create homelessness and equity programs will not be available, leaving questions as to where the money will come from to continue them. And nearly all City employees will receive a cost of living salary increase in July 2022 that was deferred in the worst days of the pandemic. New collective bargaining agreements will be negotiated next fiscal year as well.\n\nBased on these factors, among others, the Controller’s Office urges the City to refrain from adding any new, unaffordable expenditures in the coming budget as the money simply will not be there to do so. Additionally, the City should not contemplate using Reserve Fund dollars to pay for non-emergency expenditures. While Los Angeles justifiably tapped into these funds during the pandemic, the City must now stay focused on maintaining its reserves so they remain ready to assist in times of crisis.\n\nDebt\n\nThe estimated debt service requirement for FY 22-23 on the City’s long term debt is $551.2 million, which is $21.4 million less than FY 21-22 due to refunding of certain Municipal Improvement Corporation of Los Angeles (MICLA) and General Obligation Bonds. A total of $114.7 million of this sum is for principal and interest payments on the City’s $739 million in outstanding General Obligation Bonds. The remaining debt service covers the MICLA, the Wastewater and Solid Waste Resources Programs and Site-Specific Tax Revenue Debt.\n\nIn total, debt service is projected to be 4.17% of projected FY 22-23 General Fund receipts, well under the 15% limit set by the City’s debt policy.\n\nDownload the data\n\nClick here to download the City’s revenue data on our Open Data portal.",

Two-thirds of that, $7.5 billion, consists of General Fund revenues, while the rest, close to $3.98 billion, comes from numerous special purpose funds and available balances. Our updated estimate of General Fund receipts for the current fiscal year is $7.55 billion, 0.6% more than the budgeted amount and 7.1% above the last fiscal year. The General Fund is projected to end the fiscal year with a $42 million revenue surplus. Transient occupancy tax revenues will increase by 97% over last fiscal year, parking occupancy tax revenues will increase by 73%, sales tax revenues will increase by 24% and documentary transfer tax receipts will rise by 22%. Utility user’s tax receipts continue to fall this fiscal year by 4%, and revenues from licenses, permits, fees and fines will fall by 3.5%.</p>\n<h2>FY 23</h2>\n<p>While the economy is continuing to recover from the ongoing public health crisis, my office is cautiously optimistic that the direct economic impacts of the pandemic — business closures, event cancellations and travel restrictions — will be largely absent in FY 23. Although it is possible that anti-inflation actions by the Federal Reserve could influence revenues to some degree, any economic slowdown would likely impact FY 24 revenues more than FY 23.</p>\n<p>General Fund receipts for FY 23 are projected to be $7.09 billion, which is 6.1% less than the current year estimates and 5.6% under the budgeted amount. This drop will be attributable to the loss of one-time American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) funds, which will all be received by the City this year, FY 22. However, adjusting for this inevitability, General Fund revenue growth will be approximately 3.9%.</p>\n<p>This chart breaks down total City revenues in all categories (General Fund and special funds) from 2011 to 2021, along with revenue projections for this fiscal year and the next.

This concern is compounded by the fact that the extraordinary growth in transient occupancy, parking occupancy, sales and documentary transfer tax receipts will likely stabilize in the coming fiscal year, while property and business tax growth will remain moderate at around 4%.</p>\n<p>Expenses are also on track to increase considerably next fiscal year. The hundreds of millions of dollars in one-time ARPA funding used to create homelessness and equity programs will not be available, leaving questions as to where the money will come from to continue them. And nearly all City employees will receive a cost of living salary increase in July 2022 that was deferred in the worst days of the pandemic. New collective bargaining agreements will be negotiated next fiscal year as well.</p>\n<p>Based on these factors, among others, <b>the Controller’s Office urges the City to refrain from adding any new, unaffordable expenditures in the coming budget as the money simply will not be there to do so</b>. Additionally, the City should not contemplate using Reserve Fund dollars to pay for non-emergency expenditures. While Los Angeles justifiably tapped into these funds during the pandemic, the City must now stay focused on maintaining its reserves so they remain ready to assist in times of crisis.</p>\n<h1>Debt</h1>\n<p>The estimated debt service requirement for FY 22-23 on the City’s long term debt is $551.2 million, which is $21.4 million less than FY 21-22 due to refunding of certain Municipal Improvement Corporation of Los Angeles (MICLA) and General Obligation Bonds. A total of $114.7 million of this sum is for principal and interest payments on the City’s $739 million in outstanding General Obligation Bonds. The remaining debt service covers the MICLA, the Wastewater and Solid Waste Resources Programs and Site-Specific Tax Revenue Debt.</p>\n<p>In total, debt service is projected to be 4.17% of projected FY 22-23 General Fund receipts, well under the 15% limit set by the City’s debt policy.</p>\n<div id=\"viz1646086067209\" class=\"tableauPlaceholder\" style=\"position: relative; width: 100%; height: 576.75px; overflow: hidden; display: block;\"><script src=\"https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js\"></script><object class=\"tableauViz\" style=\"display: none; width: 100%; height: 576.75px;\" width=\"300\" height=\"150\"><param name=\"host_url\" value=\"https%3A%2F%2Fpublic.tableau.com%2F\"><param name=\"embed_code_version\" value=\"3\"><param name=\"site_root\" value=\"\"><param name=\"name\" value=\"RevenueForecastFY23/Debt\"><param name=\"tabs\" value=\"yes\"><param name=\"toolbar\" value=\"yes\"><param name=\"animate_transition\" value=\"yes\"><param name=\"display_static_image\" value=\"yes\"><param name=\"display_spinner\" value=\"yes\"><param name=\"display_overlay\" value=\"yes\"><param name=\"display_count\" value=\"yes\"><param name=\"language\" value=\"en-US\"><param name=\"filter\" value=\"publish=yes\"></object><div style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;right:0;bottom:0;border:0;padding:0;margin:0\"><div style=\"top:100px;left:0;right:0;position:absolute;z-index:991;box-shadow:none;display:flex;justify-content:center;\"><style>#tableau-svg-spinner-container-2{width:65px;height:65px;border-radius:10px;display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center}#tableau-svg-spinner-2{width:50px;height:50px;-webkit-animation:tableau-svg-spinner-animation 1s linear infinite;animation:tableau-svg-spinner-animation 1s linear infinite}@-webkit-keyframes tableau-svg-spinner-animation{100%{-webkit-transform:rotate(360deg)}}@keyframes tableau-svg-spinner-animation{100%{transform:rotate(360deg)}}</style><div id=\"tableau-svg-spinner-container-2\"><svg id=\"tableau-svg-spinner-2\" viewBox=\"0 0 50 50\"><style>#tail{fill:url(#tableau-fade-2)}#head{fill:#616570}stop{stop-color:#616570}</style><linearGradient id=\"tableau-fade-2\" x2=\"50\" y1=\"25\" y2=\"25\" gradientUnits=\"userSpaceOnUse\"><stop offset=\"0\" stop-opacity=\"0\"></stop><stop offset=\".15\" stop-opacity=\".04\"></stop><stop offset=\".3\" stop-opacity=\".16\"></stop><stop offset=\".45\" stop-opacity=\".36\"></stop><stop offset=\".61\" stop-opacity=\".64\"></stop><stop offset=\".76\"></stop></linearGradient><path id=\"head\" d=\"M0 25a25 25 0 1 0 50 0h-3.9a21.1 21.1 0 1 1-42.2 0\"></path><path id=\"tail\" d=\"M50 25a25 25 0 0 0-50 0h3.9a21.1 21.1 0 1 1 42.2 0\"></path></svg></div></div><div style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;right:0;bottom:0;z-index:990;background-color:#EBEBEB;opacity:.24\"></div></div><iframe frameborder=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" title=\"데이터 비주얼리제이션\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" class=\"tableauViz\" style=\"display: block; width: 100%; height: 576.75px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: none;\" width=\"300\" height=\"150\"></iframe></div>\n<p><script type=\"text/javascript\">                    var divElement = document.getElementById('viz1646086067209');                    var vizElement = divElement.getElementsByTagName('object')[0];                    if ( divElement.offsetWidth > 800 ) { vizElement.style.width='100%';vizElement.style.height=(divElement.offsetWidth*0.75)+'px';} else if ( divElement.offsetWidth > 500 ) { vizElement.style.width='100%';vizElement.style.height=(divElement.offsetWidth*0.75)+'px';} else { vizElement.style.width='100%';vizElement.style.minHeight='1100px';vizElement.style.maxHeight=(divElement.offsetWidth*1.77)+'px';}                     var scriptElement = document.createElement('script');                    scriptElement.src = 'https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js';                    vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement);                </script></p>\n</div><h1>Download the data</h1>\n<p><a href=\"https://controllerdata.lacity.org/Budget/Revenue-Budget-and-Receipts/6cbx-e2fd/data\">Click here to download the City’s revenue data on our Open Data portal.</a></p>\n"

Each year, my office produces the Annual Comprehensive Financial Report (ACFR), which gives a complete financial picture of the City, including revenues, expenditures, assets and liabilities. The ACFR, along with the City’s Annual Budget and the City Administrative Officer’s financial status reports, is fundamental to understanding the City’s financial opportunities and challenges. On this page is the more accessible version of the report, the Popular Annual Financial Report (PAFR), which presents the data in an easier-to-read format so that everyone can understand the finances of the City.</p>\n<p>Here’s a snapshot of the City’s finances for fiscal year 2021:</p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">$18.4 billion total City revenues, a 5.2% increase over the year prior.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">$17.3 billion in expenses, a 4.8% increase over the year prior.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">$5.7 billion in General Fund revenues, a 1.3% decrease from the year prior.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">$25.1 billion net position, a 4.3% increase over the year prior.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The report also features charts with data that measures the performance of City departments. These help elucidate how well the City is using its finances to serve the public year over year.</p>\n<p>Our goals are to educate Angelenos on the finances of the City by being as transparent as possible and empower them to be better advocates for their communities.

Tourism and hospitality, professional and business services, international trade, entertainment production, and wholesale trade and logistics all contribute significantly to local employment. The Port of Los Angeles handles the largest volume of containerized cargo of all U.S. ports and ranks as number one in cargo value for U.S. waterborne foreign traffic. Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) was the fifth busiest airport in the world as measured by revenue of enplaned passengers in calendar year 2020, and was 13th in the world in air cargo tonnage according to Airports Council International statistics, in calendar year 2019.</p>\n<p>At the beginning of fiscal year 2021, stay at home orders and travel restrictions established at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic were still in place and Los Angeles was experiencing the negative impacts of the recession, including unemployment of almost 20 percent. As the restrictions began to be lifted in late summer and early fall 2020, the economy began an uneven recovery. Some sectors, such as real estate, recovered their previous strength quickly. Other sectors, such as tourism and entertainment, have been much slower to recover and are still well short of pre-pandemic levels. Overall, unemployment in the City has dropped to a seasonally-adjusted 8.9 as of November 2021.</p>\n<p>The City’s fiscal discussions were dominated by austerity, as much of the City’s reserves had been used to balance the fiscal year 2019-20 budget and revenues were anticipated to lag behind the already conservative budget estimates. Labor agreements were reopened, resulting in deferral of raises and other payments, as well as a separation incentive program, capital projects were delayed or cancelled, and a hard hiring freeze was implemented. In addition, facing a potential General Fund revenue shortfall of $600 million, proposals were made to utilize the rest of the City’s reserves and issue debt to be used as operating capital.</p>\n<p>The passage of the federal American Rescue Plan Act in March 2021 significantly changed the fiscal outlook, as it included $1.28 billion in direct financial assistance to the City, with half to be received in FY 21 and half to be received the following year. This funding filled the revenue gap and eliminated the need to empty reserves and issue debt to balance the books. By the end of the fiscal year, the combination of federal funding and moderate improvement in revenues left the City in a strong position to face the uncertainty of the continuing pandemic.</p>\n<p>Looking forward, while the City is currently in a strong fiscal position, significant challenges lie ahead. The almost $2 billion in one-time revenue from the federal government will be gone by the end of FY 22, and the City faces difficult decisions on how to continue the programming those funds made possible while simultaneously facing renewed labor negotiations and rising inflation.</p>\n<div class=\"vc_empty_space\" style=\"height: 32px\"><span class=\"vc_empty_space_inner\"></span></div></div></div><div class=\"vc_tta-panel\" id=\"1579290472674-9147d917-ede3\" data-vc-content=\".vc_tta-panel-body\"><div class=\"vc_tta-panel-heading\"><h4 class=\"vc_tta-panel-title vc_tta-controls-icon-position-left\"><a href=\"#1579290472674-9147d917-ede3\" data-vc-accordion=\"\" data-vc-container=\".vc_tta-container\"><span class=\"vc_tta-title-text\">City Organization</span><i class=\"vc_tta-controls-icon vc_tta-controls-icon-plus\"></i></a></h4></div><div class=\"vc_tta-panel-body\"><div class=\"vc_empty_space\" style=\"height: 32px\"><span class=\"vc_empty_space_inner\"></span></div><p>The City operates under a Mayor-Council form of government. The Mayor supervises the administrative processes of the City and works with the City Council in matters relating to legislation, budget and finance. The 15-member City Council enacts ordinances, levies taxes, authorizes contracts and public improvements, adopts zoning and other land use contracts, and provides necessary resources for the budgetary departments and offices of the City. The City Controller and City Attorney are independently elected citywide.</p>\n<p>The City has 46 departments, bureaus, commissions and offices, 39 of which have their operating funds annually budgeted by the City Council. The Department of Water and Power, Harbor Department, and the Department of Airports are publicly-owned entities under the control of boards appointed by the Mayor and confirmed by the City Council. Several other departments are fiscally independent or under the control of independent boards.</p>\n<p>Public services provided by the City include police, fire and paramedics, residential refuse collection and disposal, wastewater collection and treatment, street maintenance and traffic management, enforcement of building safety laws, libraries, recreation and parks, community development, housing and services for seniors, planning; two airports, harbor, power and water services, and the convention center.

Program revenues are resources obtained from parties outside of the City and charges for services between the governmental and business-type activities.</p>\n<p>Total expenses increased by $800 million or 9.2% above FY 20. Increased expenses were due to increased pension and OPEB costs of $352.6 million, additional liability claims expenses of $269.2 million, and a contracts, equipment, and supplies increase of $243.9 million, offset by a combined decrease in salaries, human resources benefits, and interest expense of $65.3 million.</p>\n<p><b>Business-Type Activities</b></p>\n<p>The $8.2 billion combined operating revenues of the City’s six business-type activities were $1.4 billion more than the $6.8 billion combined operating costs.</p>\n<p><b>Business-Type Activities: Change in Net Position</b></p>\n<p>Enterprise funds are used to report the functions presented as business-type activities in the government-wide financial statements, they are generally used to account for services for which the City charges customers – either outside customers or other departments/funds of the City.

    "textofpage": "One of the City Controller’s primary responsibilities is analyzing and reporting on the City’s financial health. The Preliminary Financial Report, made available each October after the City closes its books, is the first of such report each year. It provides information on how the City spent its money over the past fiscal year, with data and analysis of the City’s revenues and expenditures, reserves and bonded indebtedness.\n\nLast year was unlike any other in the City’s history. Although the fiscal year ended solidly because of spending cuts and the infusion of federal funds, tough choices will almost certainly arise next year’s budget. Scroll below to view the report summary with interactive data visualizations, followed by the full text of the report.\n\nRevenues\n\nDuring the 2020-21 fiscal year, total revenues in budgeted funds increased by 0.7%. The COVID-19 pandemic caused revenues to come in 6.8% short of projections. View this interactive data visualization to explore the relative size of the City’s revenue sources and their growth over the past 10 years.\n\nExpenditures\n\nTotal budgeted expenditures shrank at a rate of 1.7%, due in large part to a hiring freeze, deferral of employee salary increases and deferral of capital improvement projects. This interactive data visualization compares the expenditures of the City’s different departments, as well as non-departmental expenditures, over the past 10 years.\n\nReserves\n\nThe Reserve Fund is established to ensure that funds are available for unanticipated expenditures and revenue shortfalls in the General Fund. The City’s Reserve Fund Policy sets a goal for the Reserve Fund to be at least 5% of the General Fund budget every year. On July 1, 2021, the Reserve Fund had a balance of $647 million, 8.62% of the General Fund budget and well above the 5% Reserve Fund Policy goal.\n\nThe Budget Stabilization Fund (BSF) was added to the City Charter in 2011. The purpose of the BSF is to set aside funds when the City exceeds revenue projections to help smooth out years when revenue is stagnant or in decline. In fiscal year 2021, the BSF grew slightly to $118.2 million and is now 1.6% of General Fund revenues. Click the chart below to view the performance of the Reserve Fund and Budget Stabilization Fund, both in dollar terms and as a percentage of budgeted General Fund revenues.\n\nDebt\n\nThe City’s debt management policy establishes guidelines for the structure and management of the City’s debt obligations. These guidelines include a non-voter-approved debt service cap of 6% and a total debt service cap of 15% as a percent of General Fund revenues. The City’s debt service obligations decreased to 4.9% last fiscal year.\n\nRecommendations\n\nThe City’s immediate fiscal situation is solid, but to address the challenges of the future, the Controller makes the following recommendations in the Preliminary Financial Report:\n\nStrengthen the City’s revenues and control ongoing costs.\n\nWhile some revenues have remained strong through the pandemic, others have decreased significantly. It is critical to the City’s recovery that revenue generation and collection be restored. At the same time, the City must limit the growth of ongoing expenditures so that it does not commit to unsustainable levels of future spending.\n\nBuild on successful new programs and consider ending those that are not delivering results.\n\nThe 2021-22 budget provides significant funding to begin pilot projects and new programs, many focused on alleviating homelessness and increasing local equity. The City should analyze these efforts critically and commit to ongoing funding only for those programs that demonstrate measurable success.\n\nMaintain the City’s strong Reserve Fund.\n\nAfter a decade of building up the Reserve Fund, the City used almost $200 million to offset a General Fund shortfall at the end of Fiscal Year 2019-20. Now, with the City’s largest ever Reserve Fund balance, there could be a temptation to treat it as a source of funds for new programs. However, the City should guard these reserved and only use them to fund the most critically important one-time programs or this important tool will not be available the next time Los Angeles needs it.\n\nUtilize the City’s capital program and debt capacity to meet community needs and drive equity.\n\nAs part of the effort to reduce expenditures during the first half of Fiscal Year 2020-21, the City cut funding from a large number of capital projects. The capital program will likely be rebuilt in the coming months, providing a perfect opportunity to leverage capital needs and build equity in the City’s under-resourced and historically disadvantaged neighborhoods.\n\nCOVER LETTER\n\nOctober 21, 2021\n\nHonorable Eric Garcetti, Mayor\n\nHonorable Members of the Los Angeles City Council\n\nRe: Preliminary Financial Report for Fiscal Year 2020-21\n\nThe Controller’s Office submits the Preliminary Financial Report (PFR) each fall to review the City of Los Angeles’ financial operations for the prior fiscal year. Our report is the City’s first look back at municipal finances after the close of the fiscal year, providing an overview and analysis of revenues and expenditures, reserves and bonded indebtedness. In early 2022, my office will follow up by issuing the Annual Financial Report for 2020-21, which is prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles and audited by an independent firm of certified public accountants.\n\nAccompanying the PFR are online interactive visualizations with 10 years of data, which can be found at lacontroller.org/pfr2021. Information on special fund balances and uses, Reserve Fund starting balances over the years, and budget appropriations, adjustments, expenditures and revenues, are also on my website.\n\nThe report is prepared to help City leaders understand and assess the state of the City’s finances — an especially important task given that we are still emerging from the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the unique nature of the economic situation, assessing the impact of the pandemic on revenues and expenditures, reserves and outstanding debt — all of which are discussed in the report — along with the assistance provided by the federal government, is critical to navigating the current fiscal year and those ahead.\n\nChallenging year until help arrived\n\nThe first eight months of the previous fiscal year were months of austerity. Hiring freezes, wage cuts, cancelled capital projects and other money-saving measures were implemented to compensate for a projected $600 million budget shortfall. The last four months of the year brought a reversal of fortunes as help arrived. COVID-19 vaccines became widely available, allowing for a partial economic reopening, and the federal government passed the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (ARPA), which included $1.28 billion in direct funding to the City, half of which was received in May 2021.\n\nOther facts about the 2020-21 fiscal year highlighted in the PFR are the following:\n\nTotal revenues in budgeted funds were $9.23 billion last year, a 0.7 percent increase over the previous year. This figure does not include ARPA assistance, which helped the City end the year in a cash surplus.\nTotal expenditures were $8.8 billion, 1.7 percent lower than the year prior, largely because of the City’s hiring freeze and employee sacrifices.\nThe pandemic underscored how essential reserves are to the City and the need to build them when possible. While they were depleted somewhat during fiscal year 2020-21, the adjusted Reserve Fund balance in July 2021 was $647 million or 8.62 percent of General Fund receipts anticipated in the current budget — higher than it has ever been. \n\nDifficult decisions loom\n\nAlthough the PFR reviews last fiscal year’s numbers, which ended solidly thanks to the infusion of ARPA funds, next year could bring different budgeting challenges. One notable issue is the use of one-time ARPA funding, which allowed the creation of most of the new programming in the 2021-22 budget. This funding will not be available to continue these programs in 2022-23, as all of it is spoken for in the current budget — a reality that could force some tough decisions about the continuation of these programs in the next budget. In addition, the current budget includes almost $300 million in programs funded by prior year appropriations, including $70 million reallocated from the Police Department in July 2020. The City needs to thoroughly and honestly assess the performance of these programs over the course of the year to determine which are successful and which fall short of their goals. \n\nAnother worry is increased expenses in the form of pay and benefits for City employees, many of whom will receive raises soon and see new labor contracts negotiated thereafter. Greater costs could hinder the City’s ability to maintain services, especially if the economy does not rebound as projected. To proactively address these issues, my office recommends that the City focus on increasing revenues where possible and limit spending on novel programs and department requests. \n\nUse capital program and debt financing to promote equity\n\nThe City’s debt service requirements decreased from 5.6 percent to 4.9 percent of General Fund revenues last fiscal year, remaining considerably below the 15 percent policy limit. The significant level of debt capacity presents the City with an opportunity to explore additional debt financing opportunities, which could help create jobs and improve neighborhoods through infrastructure projects. These efforts should benefit areas of Los Angeles that were disproportionately impacted by the pandemic and in historically disadvantaged communities to achieve greater regional equity.\n\nMy staff and I appreciate the cooperation shown by City departments as we prepared the PFR. Should you have questions or need more information, please contact my Director of Financial Analysis and Reporting, Matthew Crawford: (213) 978-7203 or matthew.crawford@lacity.org.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nRON GALPERIN\nL.A. Controller\n\ncc:    Sharon Tso, Chief Legislative Analyst\nMatt Szabo, City Administrative Officer\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nAt the close of each fiscal year, the Office of the Controller reports on the finances of the City for the year that recently closed. This Preliminary Financial Report is the first part of that reporting and provides cash basis information on revenues, expenditures, reserves, and bonded indebtedness, including comparisons to the prior year and to the Budget.\n\nThe second part of this reporting requirement is the Annual Financial Report (AFR), the City’s official, audited financial statement, which will be released later this fiscal year. Together, these two documents educate and inform both City decision-makers and the public on the City’s financial position.\n\nA Year of Uncertainty\n\nFiscal year 2020-21 began in a state of widespread uncertainty. The nation was three months into the COVID-19 pandemic with stay-at-home emergency orders in place. The impact the pandemic would have on the City’s economy was unknown, and the potential for assistance from the federal government was unclear. Due to this uncertainty, the City Council did not revise the Mayor’s Proposed Budget as it usually does, but left it instead to become “the official budget” in accordance with the City Charter, acknowledging that revisions would be necessary throughout the year. By the end of June 2020, it was clear that the financial and social landscape had already changed, and the Council passed significant budget amendments on July 1.\n\nFor the first eight months of the Fiscal Year, the City operated in an environment of austerity. Hiring freezes, mandatory budget reductions, amended labor contracts, deferral or cancellation of capital projects, and a Separation Incentive Plan were all implemented in order to mitigate what was at one point projected to be a revenue shortfall of more than $600 million.\n\nThe final third of the Fiscal Year saw a reversal of fortunes. COVID-19 vaccines became widely available, allowing for a partial economic reopening. The federal government passed the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (ARPA), which included direct funding to the City of almost $1.3 billion, half of which was received in May 2021. Other grants and funding streams from the federal and state governments were also approved bringing much-needed funding for COVID-19 and homelessness response efforts. Fortunately, an uneven economic recovery resulted in General Fund revenues performing better than feared, finishing the year only $317 million below budget.\n\nCombining improved revenues with savings from nine months of hiring freezes and budget cuts, the General Fund ended the year with an unexpectedly large surplus to transfer to the Reserve Fund, which resulted in Fiscal Year 2021-22 starting with a record-high balance of $640 million, $385 million more than twelve months earlier.\n\nThe Fiscal Year 2021-22 Budget was adopted with a framework of economic and social recovery, and the second tranche of the ARPA funds and other funding sources were programmed to finance more than $900 million in homelessness response and equity programs. The Budget projects a strong rebound, with 7.7 percent growth in General Fund revenue, not including the ARPA funding. While it is still too early to make accurate projections, the first three months of this Fiscal Year have shown signs of growth.\n\nHowever, the future will bring significant challenges. Most of the new programming contained in the Fiscal Year 2021-22 Budget is backed by one-time funding which means these new programs will not continue in 2022-23 unless additional funding is identified. In addition, many City employees are due to receive a deferred pay increase at the end of the current Fiscal Year (June 30, 2022), after which most of the City’s Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs) expire. The collective bargaining process that will follow will likely lead to additional long-term obligatory costs, especially as predictions of cost inflation begin to impact decision-making. There are also approximately $300 million in programs in the current year that are funded from prior year appropriations, including almost $70 million in funding that was reallocated from the Police Department in July 2020.\n\nThe combination of the cessation of one-time monies, new programs and priorities, and labor negotiations means that the Fiscal Year 2022-23 budget process will inevitably require difficult choices and trade-offs. A renewed Reserve Fund may provide some limited ability to defer these decisions or fund individual projects, but doing so would substantially weaken the City’s ability to weather future economic crises without another round of destabilizing cuts.\n\nRecommendations\n\nStrengthen the City’s revenues and control ongoing costs.\n\nWhile some revenues have remained strong through the current crisis, others have decreased significantly. It is critical to the City’s recovery that revenue generation and collection be restored. At the same time, we must limit growth in the City’s ongoing costs so that we do not commit to unsustainable levels of future spending.\n\nBuild on successful new programs and consider ending those that are not delivering results.\n\nThe Fiscal Year 2021-22 Budget provides significant funding to begin pilot projects and new programs. The City should analyze these efforts critically and commit to ongoing funding only for those programs which demonstrate success.\n\nMaintain the City’s strong Reserve Fund.\n\nAfter a decade of building up the Reserve Fund, the City used almost $200 million to offset a General Fund shortfall at the end of Fiscal Year 2019-20. Now, with the largest Reserve Fund the City has ever had, there will naturally be a temptation to treat it as a source of funds for new programs. However, these reserves should be guarded and only used to fund the most critically important, one-time programs, or this important tool will not be available the next time it is needed.\n\nUtilize the City’s capital program and debt capacity to meet critical needs and drive equity.\n\nAs part of the effort to reduce expenditures during the first half of Fiscal Year 2020-21, funding was cut from a large number of capital projects. The next budget year will likely see a rebuilding of the City’s capital program, providing a perfect opportunity to leverage capital needs and building equity in the City’s under-resourced and disadvantaged neighborhoods. The City should consider capital projects as another method of reorienting the City’s built environment to benefit historically disadvantaged neighborhoods and people.\n\nThe Preliminary Financial Report is organized in four distinct sections:\n\nRevenues and Expenditures: A discussion of the fiscal year that just ended, including trend analysis, notable changes from prior years, and financial performance relative to the Budget;\nReserve Fund: A discussion of the current condition of the City’s Reserve Fund, and analysis of the various factors influencing that figure;\nBudget Stabilization Fund: A discussion of the Fund policy and how actual figures compare to the policy; and\nBonded Indebtedness: A statement of the City’s total bonded indebtedness and debt service requirements; as well as comparisons to City policies and legal limitations.\n\n \n\nRevenues and Expenditures\n\nTotal Budgeted Revenue was 6.8 percent below the Budget, growing by 0.7 percent over Fiscal Year 2019-20, and 1.6 percent over Fiscal Year 2018-19. General Fund revenue fell by 0.1 percent compared to last year, and was 4.8 percent below the Budget. Significant shortfalls in Transient Occupancy Tax, Sales Tax, Parking Users’ Tax, Departmental Receipts, the Special Parking Revenue Fund transfer, and Parking Fines were partially offset by healthy growth in Property Tax, strong growth in Documentary Transfer Tax, and one-time revenue from federal grants. Revenue in budgeted special funds increased by 2.4 percent over the prior year; however, it was 11.0 percent under the budget due to shortfalls in building permit revenues, State Proposition A revenues, and a delay in Sewer Construction and Maintenance Fund bond issuance. Receipts from the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (ARPA) are not included in Budgeted Revenue because the funds were not included in the 2020-21 Budget and the receipts were transferred to the General Fund as cash and not appropriated for spending.\n\nBoth expenditures and encumbrances declined, 1.7 and 33.7 percent respectively, from June 30, 2020 to June 30, 2021. While all of the categories of spending dropped, the Capital Improvement Expenditure Program contracted the most, followed by Liability Claims, and Proposition A Local Transit Assistance.\n\nReserve Fund\n\nThe Reserve Fund served its purpose in Fiscal Year 2019-20, when it absorbed the $195.5 million General Fund revenue shortfall. The City also front-funded pandemic related costs using reserves. As a result, the Reserve Fund Balance started Fiscal Year 2020-21 at just 3.9 percent of the General Fund Budget, below the 5 percent policy goal. However, due to the combination of ARPA funds, fourth quarter revenue growth, and reduced General Fund expenditures, the Reserve Fund began Fiscal Year 2021-22 at 8.62 percent of the General Fund Budget.\n\nBudget Stabilization Fund\n\nThe Budget Stabilization Fund (BSF) is the City’s mechanism for accumulating excess tax revenues in growth years in order to mitigate shortfalls in lean years. During the year, the BSF was proposed to be used as part of the budget balancing solution. However, as it turned out, such action was unnecessary, and the June 30, 2021 balance in the Fund was $118.2 million.\n\nBonded Indebtedness\n\nBonded indebtedness and the City’s debt service obligations decreased due to the defeasance and advance refunding of MICLA Revenue Bonds Series 2014 and 2019 and the lack of any large new issuance of General Obligation Bonds. Debt service payments decreased as well, from 5.6 percent to 4.9 percent of General Fund revenue, and are well under the City’s 15 percent policy ceiling.\n\nSECTION I: REVENUES AND EXPENDITURES\n\nTotal revenues in budgeted funds for 2020-21 were $9.23 billion, an increase of 0.7 percent compared to 2019-20, and increase of 1.6 percent over 2018-19. The revenues do not include the ARPA funding of $639.5 million received in May that was transferred to the General Fund.\n\nTotal expenditures (excluding encumbrances) from budgeted funds decreased by 1.7 percent to $8.8 billion, which includes $516.3 million payments of prior year’s encumbrances. In addition to the expenditures, the City had $516.4 million encumbered as of June 30, 2021.\n\nExhibit 1 below shows the ten-year history of total revenues and expenditures.\n\n*Excluding transfers from reserves\n\nSince 2011-12, revenues have grown by 40.2 percent (average annual growth of 3.9 percent), while expenditures have grown by 43.2 percent (average annual growth of 4.1 percent). As seen in Exhibit 1, revenues have consistently exceeded expenditures. Most of this excess has been in the City’s many budgeted special funds. The surplus in the General Fund has been a much smaller portion of the total, but still has allowed the City to grow the Reserve and Budget Stabilization Funds.\n\nThe 2020-21 Budget totaled $9.90 billion (excluding $628.4 million in available balances), of which $6.69 billion was in the General Fund and $3.21 billion was in Special Funds. Actual receipts for the year (again excluding available balances) were $9.23 billion, 6.8 percent less than budgeted, while total expenditures (including encumbrances) were $9.32 billion, 11.5 percent less than budgeted. Detail of budgeted and actual receipts and expenditures is presented in Schedules III and IV.\n\nGeneral Fund Revenues\n\nThe General Fund is the primary operating fund of the City. It is used to account for all financial resources except those legally required to be accounted for in other funds. General Fund revenues are derived from such sources as taxes, licenses, permits, fees, fines, intergovernmental revenues, charges for services, special assessments, and interest income. Exhibit 2 presents 2020-21 actual General Fund revenues by percentage.\n\n2020-21 General Fund receipts totaled $6.37 billion, $317.4 million (4.8 percent) less than the Budget, $4.25 million (0.1 percent) less than 2019-20, and $138.9 million (2.2 percent) more than 2018-19. Over the past five years, General Fund revenue averaged 3.9 percent growth, slightly exceeding the Budget twice and coming up a little short three times. In Fiscal Year 2020-21, General Fund revenue decreased from the prior year, the first time this occurred in more than a decade. Exhibit 3 below presents a comparison between adopted and actual General Fund receipts by fiscal year.\n\n*Excluding transfers from reserves\n\nGeneral Fund revenues that outperformed the Budget in 2020-21 included Business Tax ($5.8 million or 0.9 percent over budget), Documentary Transfer Tax ($20.1 million or 9.3 percent), Franchise Income ($3.1 million or 3.8 percent), Gas User’s Tax ($6.4 million or 9.6 percent), and Grant Receipts ($31.2 million or 248.9 percent).\n\nProperty Tax receipts were $129.0 million (6.1 percent) higher than 2019-20 receipts, but lower than the budget by $35.7 million or 1.6 percent. Ex-CRA Property Tax Increment revenue was $32.1 million over the budget and $44.0 million more than the prior year.\n\nThe Budget assumed 4.5 percent growth for Business Tax receipts, and actual receipts were 5.6 percent or $36.5 million higher than last year, and 0.9 percent or $5.8 million over the Budget. Recreational cannabis Business Tax generated $136.8 million in revenues, and its share in the total Business Tax grew from 11.9 percent to 19.8 percent. Actual receipts exceeded the Budget by $37.5 million (37.7 percent), and exceeded last year’s total by $58.5 million (74.7 percent). Meanwhile non-cannabis Business Tax actual receipts of $555.6 million were 5.4 percent or $31.6 million lower than the Budget, and 3.8 percent or $22.0 million lower than last year.\n\nSales Tax Receipts were $31.6 million or 5.7 percent lower than last year, and $32.4 million or 5.8 percent lower than the Budget. Along with pandemic-related closures, the Tax Deferment Program implemented by the State affected the collected revenues. Due to lack of detailed data, it is virtually impossible to differentiate these two impacts, so we do not know how much of the reduced receipts will be recovered in future periods.\n\nFranchise Income ended higher than Budget by $3.1 million, mainly due to Natural Gas Franchise income that exceeded the Budget by $2.4 million.\n\nUtility Users’ Tax was 0.1 percent below the Budget, and 3.6 percent lower than last year’s actual receipts. While Gas Users Tax exceeded the Budget by $6.4 million, Electrical Users and Telephone Users Taxes were a combined $5.7 million (1.0 percent) under the Budget.\n\nLicenses, Permits, Fees and Fines ended $77.8 million or 5.8 percent lower than the Budget, but higher than last year ($59.2 million or 4.9 percent). The picture would have been significantly worse without the $125 million reimbursement of City Expenditures from COVID-19 Federal Relief Fund. Departmental receipts (relating mainly to licenses, permits, and various service fees collected by departments) were $11.9 million below the budgeted amounts. Other components of Licenses, Permits, Fees and Fines were short as well (Emergency Ambulance Services $21.0 million, Services to the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (LACMTA) $27.9 million, and Services to Proprietary Departments 26.9 million). The shortfall in reimbursements from special funds, excluding the COVID-19 Federal Relief Fund transfer, was $115.1 million.\n\nAs a result of the March 22, 2020, Federal Major Disaster Declaration related to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Public Assistance program will reimburse state and local governments for pandemic-related emergency protective measures. The City has applied for, and FEMA has approved, this assistance for the City. As a result, the City received $30.7 million in Fiscal Year 2020-21 and will receive additional reimbursements in future years.\n\nTransient Occupancy Tax (TOT, commonly known as Hotel Tax) receipts experienced the most conspicuous decline, as travel and hospitality virtually stopped. TOT was $134.4 million or 54.9 percent below budget and $143.1 million or 56.5 percent less than last year. Receipts near the end of Fiscal Year 2020-21 and the beginning of the current fiscal year have shown some growth, but still far below pre-COVID levels.\n\nExhibit 4 shows cumulative Transient Occupancy Tax monthly receipts for FY 2019, FY 2020 and FY 2021.\n\nThe pandemic’s impact on the lodging industry will likely continue to evolve, rather than disappear. The level of vaccination and consumer confidence, both domestically and internationally, will determine how quickly the industry will recover and experience to a meaningful acceleration in demand.\n\nDocumentary Transfer Tax receipts were $20.1 million or 9.3 percent above the Budget and $30.4 million or 14.8 percent above last year. The pandemic briefly stalled the market at the end of Fiscal Year 2019-20, but home prices continued to rise and sales remained strong, leading to a record high for receipts in this category.\n\nThe Power Revenue Transfer was $5.7 million (2.6 percent) less than budget.  It has been declining slowly since 2016, with a 3.9 percent average decrease over the last five years.\n\nExhibit 5 below displays a 10-year history of General Fund receipts, excluding transfers from the Reserve Fund.\n\nAppropriations, Expenditures & Encumbrances\n\nTotal expenditures, including encumbrances, were $9.32 billion. This was $410.9 million or 4.2 percent lower than 2019-20, and $1.21 billion or 11.5 percent lower than the Budget.\n\nExhibit 6 below presents a comparison between the Budget, the final appropriation (which includes interim appropriations made during the year), and actual expenditures and encumbrances by fiscal year.\n\nFor the last five years total actual Expenditures and Encumbrances have grown by an average of 3.7 percent.  For the same period, Salaries (excluding Library and Recreations and Parks) increased by 4.2 percent, and Services, Supplies, Equipment and Others by 5.6 percent. Salaries are made up of Sworn and Civilian Salaries, which increased by 2.7 percent and 4.5 percent respectively.\n\nExhibit 7 below breaks out summarized categories of budgetary and actual expenditures and encumbrances for 2019-20 and 2020-21. Detailed information by department can be found in Schedule IV.\n\nNote: Appropriations to Library and Recreation and Parks include both salaries and expense accounts.\n\nSalaries decreased by $68.9 million or 1.7 percent compared to last year mainly due to reduced civilian workforce, labor agreements with most employee organizations to defer compensation adjustments that were set to take effect on 2020-21 and 2021-22 and unpaid days for all civilian employees.\n\nTotal contributions to Library and Recreation and Parks, which increased by a $13.4 million or 7.0 percent and $7.8 million or 3.5 percent respectively, are made pursuant to Charter requirements and are tied to growth in the City’s total assessed valuation.\n\nCapital Improvement Expenditure Program (CIEP) expenditures were 78.6 percent or $279.7 million lower than budget, and $214.2 million lower than the prior year. The largest decrease was in Clean Water Projects, $253.9 million compared to Budget, and $178.3 million compared to prior year actual.\n\nHuman Resources Benefits expenses were $18.3 million or 2.3 percent below the Budget, but higher by $26.5 million or 3.5 percent compared to last year. The increase was primarily due to increases in health care subsidies for employees, by $21.0 million or 4.1 percent, and Unemployment Insurance costs, which increased by $6.2 million.\n\nExhibit 8 below breaks out expenditures and encumbrances by Governmental Activity.\n\nAlmost a third of total expenditures were spent on Protection of Persons and Property. Even as priorities have shifted and the economy has expanded, this percentage has remained remarkably stable.\n\nAlso of note were the contributions to the City’s pension systems, which totaled $1.43 billion, 15.3 percent of total spending. This is up slightly from the prior year. To the extent that the City is able to hold salary expenditures under long-term averages, the increase will be mitigated, but this issue should be monitored carefully.\n\nThe City ended the Fiscal Year with a total of $516.4 million in encumbrances:  $356.8 million in the General Fund and $159.5 million in special funds, $110.9 million was encumbered for salaries to be paid in July 2021, with the balance encumbered in expense, equipment, and special fund project accounts.\n\nEncumbered funds for salaries are earmarked for the last pay period of the fiscal year and unspent funds are immediately released after payroll is made. Funds encumbered for expense accounts are continued across fiscal years to ensure that cash is available to cover the expenditure when it is made. Schedule V provides a listing of General Fund encumbrances by department.\n\nThe General Fund Encumbrance Policy provides that encumbered funds that remain unspent for a period longer than one Fiscal Year shall be disencumbered every fiscal year, with the exception of capital project funds.  Prior-year encumbrances are automatically disencumbered unless exempted by Mayor and Council approval. As part of the 2020-21 Year-End Financial Status Report, a total of $53.0 million was exempted from being disencumbered, a decrease of $4.1 million from last year’s exemptions. As noted in past years, this is an issue which deserves more attention.\n\nUnencumbered General funds revert to the Reserve Fund at year end. As such, exemptions to the automatic disencumbrance policy reduce reversions, thereby reducing the cash available in the Reserve Fund to pay for emergencies and contingencies. Section II below discusses the status of the Reserve Fund in more detail.\n\nSECTION II: RESERVE FUND\n\nThe Reserve Fund is established to ensure that funds are available for unanticipated expenditures and revenue shortfalls in the General Fund, and is broken into an Emergency Account and a Contingency Account.\n\nThe Emergency Reserve Account is fixed at 2.75 percent of the adopted General Fund receipts. A finding of urgent economic necessity is required to use these funds. The Contingency Reserve Account includes all monies in the Reserve Fund over and above the amount required to be allocated to the Emergency Account. Contingency Reserve Account funds can be a source of additional funding to cover unanticipated expenses or revenue shortfalls.\n\nThe City’s Reserve Fund Policy (CF 98-0459) sets a Reserve Fund cash balance goal of at least 5.0 percent of budgeted General Fund receipts. Exhibit 9 below displays the past ten years of beginning Emergency and Contingency Reserve Fund balances compared to this policy target.\n\nThe Reserve Fund is a major indicator of the City’s fiscal health, and is vital to cash flow, bond ratings, and the ability to manage financial challenges as we did in 2019-20, when almost $200 million from the Reserve Fund to balance the General Fund revenue shortfall.\n\nFailure to keep the City’s Reserve Fund at an appropriate level not only exposes the City to significant risk in the event of an emergency, but can also have negative financial impacts due to increased cost of borrowing.\n\nReserve Fund Status\n\nAfter the 2020-21 accounting close, budgetary appropriations, return of advances, and reappropriations, the Fiscal Year-start adjusted Reserve Fund balance was $647.0 million or 8.62 percent of General Fund receipts anticipated in the 2021-22 Budget, $271.9 million above the 5.0 percent Reserve Fund Policy goal.\n\nExhibit 10, below, shows Adopted and Actual Beginning Reserve Fund Balances for last ten years.\n\nThe Beginning Reserve Fund balance for 2021-22 is at the highest level for the last ten years, after reaching the lowest in 2020-21, and is $137.2 million more than the assumed in the Fiscal Year 2021-22 Adopted Budget.\n\nAdjustments to the Reserve Fund Cash Balance\n\nAt the end of each Fiscal Year and the beginning of the next, a number of transactions are required to accurately reflect the status of the Reserve Fund through the closing of the City’s books. Exhibit 11 details the year-end and year-start adjustments to the Reserve Fund Cash Balance, comparing Budget versus actual.\n\n* Reappropriations and Transfer to Budget are actually completed after July 1.\n\nFollowing are descriptions of the line item changes to the Reserve Fund listed in Exhibit 11:\n\nReserve Fund Cash Balance (June 30, 2021)\n\nAs of June 30, 2021, after closing the City’s General Ledger, the recorded Reserve Fund balance was $647.0 million. This was $137.2 million more than the amount anticipated in the 2021-22 Budget. The Reserve Fund cash balance is adjusted by the following factors to arrive at the year-end balance:\n\nBalance Before Year-End Reversions/Borrowings\n\nThe amount of cash available in the Contingency Reserve prior to adjustments for year-end reversions, unallocated revenues, and borrowings. It does not include cash in the Emergency Reserve. For 2020-21, this amount was higher than anticipated in the budget due to higher than anticipated return of advances and early reversion made after the adoption of the budget.\n\nReversion of Uncommitted Balances\n\nUncommitted General Fund appropriations are reverted to the Reserve Fund at fiscal year-end. Appropriations (spending authority) granted to City departments by the Mayor and Council are committed throughout the year in the form of encumbrances and expenditures. Remaining or uncommitted balances are reverted to the Reserve Fund to the extent that there is available cash in the General Fund.\n\nIn 2020-21, the budget estimated $386.1 million in reversions. The uncommitted balance at year end was $418.3 million. Excluding unfunded appropriations, a total of $279.3 million reverted to the Reserve Fund. For a detailed breakdown of uncommitted balances by department, please see Schedule VII.\n\nYear-End Unallocated Revenue\n\nUnallocated revenue occurs when revenues exceed the total budget appropriation. At Fiscal Year-end, excess receipts of $295.7 million reverted to the Reserve Fund as unallocated revenue. The 2021-22 Adopted Budget anticipated $45.9 million in unallocated revenue. Actual receipts were $249.8 million more than the budgeted unallocated revenue.\n\nAdvances Under CF 20-0600-S91\n\nCouncil File 20-0600-S91 authorized the Controller to borrow from the Reserve Fund at year-end to balance departmental budgets where needed in order to facilitate the closing of the City’s General Ledger. The Controller is authorized to increase appropriations within established limits without getting itemized Mayor and Council approval, a process that would delay the closing of the City’s General Ledger. Advances were made to Fire and Personnel Departments in the amount of $83,320 and $21,913 respectively.\n\nAdvances Under Charter Section 261(i) for Unfunded Encumbrances and Expenditures\n\nUnder Charter Section 261(i), the Controller transfers funds from the Reserve Fund as a loan to any fund that becomes depleted due to tardy receipt of revenue. The 2021-22 Budget estimated $50.0 million in year-end advances. Actual advances were $49.6 million, consisting of $35.3 million in unfunded expenditures and $14.3 million in unfunded encumbrances. See Schedule VIII for a breakdown by department.\n\nUnfunded expenditures generally occur when transactions take place prior to receipt of funding (e.g. grants on reimbursement basis) and/or due to billing delays. When the funding source reimburses the costs, departments are able to repay the advances. If funding is not available, departments may request Mayor and Council approval to write-off the advances. Unfunded encumbered amounts represent a technical adjustment at year-end and are reversed at the start of the new Fiscal Year as documented in item (f), below.\n\nReserve Fund Cash Balance (2021-22 Year-Start)\n\nThe year-end Reserve Fund cash balance is not the same as the year-start cash balance for the next year. The following technical adjustments are made after the close of the prior Fiscal Year, but are accounted for in determining the year-start cash balance:\n\nReturn of Advances for Unfunded Encumbrances\n\nAdvances for unfunded encumbrances are reversed at the start of the following fiscal year, as discussed in item (e), above.\n\nTransfer to Budget\n\nThe 2021-22 Budget includes $85,090,146 transfer from Reserve Fund to Budget, which is made during the Fiscal Year by the Controller depending on the cash condition.\n\nReappropriations\n\nThe 2021-22 Budget and other Council actions (C.F. 21-0600-S104, 20-0600-S83, 20-0600-S94, 20-0841, 19-0914, and 21-0882) provided that certain uncommitted balances earmarked for specific programs would be reappropriated in the subsequent year if not expended by the year-end. See Schedule VII for reappropriations by department. Actual reappropriations of $215.2 million were $5.4 million above the estimated $209.8 million Budget.\n\nSECTION III: BUDGET STABILIZATION FUND\n\nThe Budget Stabilization Fund (BSF) was added to the City’s Charter in 2011. The purpose of this fund is to set aside revenues during periods of robust economic growth or when revenue projections are exceeded to help smooth out years when revenue is stagnant or is in decline. The BSF does not have a minimum balance that must be maintained.\n\nThe June 30 BSF cash balance was $118.2 million. Exhibit 12 below displays the adopted and prior year cash balance and adjustments of the BSF. The Budget does not include a deposit into the Fund after 2019-20.\n\nThe current BSF Policy (approved January 21, 2020) states that a budget appropriation shall be included as part of the Budget for the following fiscal year when the anticipated growth in combined receipts from seven City “economically sensitive” revenue categories (Property Tax, Utility Users Tax, Business Tax, Sales Tax, Documentary Transfer Tax, Transient Occupancy Tax, and Parking Users Tax) exceeds the growth threshold.  For each five-tenths of one percent that the anticipated growth exceeds the growth threshold, the amount of the required appropriation to the BSF shall be equal to five percent of the value of the anticipated excess growth. The maximum appropriation shall be equivalent to 25 percent of the value of the growth above the growth threshold. For Fiscal Year 2021-22, the growth rate used to determine BSF contributions was recalculated to be 4.1 percent, based on the 20-year historical average of these tax revenues.\n\nThe required deposit to the BSF may be forgone completely in the case that the City Council and Mayor declare a fiscal emergency or suspend the BSF funding policy based on findings that it is in the best interest of the City to suspend the policy. Mid-year deposits to the BSF or deposits above the required amount may be authorized by the City Council, subject to the approval of the Mayor, at any time during the year from various General Fund sources. Consideration should be given to depositing unanticipated and unbudgeted receipts that are not otherwise required to balance the current year budget.\n\n\nSECTION IV: BONDED INDEBTEDNESS\n\nThe City’s Debt Management Policy creates guidelines for the structure and management of the City’s debt obligations. These guidelines include target and ceiling levels for certain debt ratios to be used for planning purposes. The two most significant ratios are a non-voter-approved debt service cap as a percent of General Fund revenues of 6 percent and a total debt service cap as a percent of General Fund revenues of 15 percent.\n\nExhibit 13, below, illustrates the City’s compliance with these debt management policies for the past five years.\n\nThe actual ratio of Debt Service to General Fund Receipts (excluding the ARPA transfer of $639.5 million) was 4.92 percent in 2020-21, comprised of 2.89 percent for non-voter approved debt and 2.03 percent for voter approved debt. The ratio decreased due to defeasance and advance refunding of MICLA Revenue Bonds Series 2014 and 2019. Schedule IX shows the details of Outstanding General Obligation Bonded Debt.\n\nExhibit 13 above shows very clearly the responsibility the City has exhibited when it comes to debt management. Good administration of debt service obligations has put the City in a position to consider major projects, as well as making strategic financing agreements available when these present financial advantages.\n\nThis significant amount of debt capacity also indicates an opportunity to invest in large-scale long-term infrastructure projects, including both facility repair and replacement as well as new projects designed to stimulate economic development. Such an investment would also provide an opportunity to focus on regional equity, focusing investment in areas of the City which have often been left behind in prior initiatives. More generally, a significantly expanded capital program would serve as a fiscal stimulus for the entire region, adding jobs to a struggling economy and providing the infrastructure for future opportunity.\n\nSECTION V: RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nOver the coming years, the City will emerge from the public health and economic crises we’ve been experiencing. This period will feature political transitions as well as economic transitions. The City’s immediate fiscal position is strong, but the many critical priorities and limited ongoing funding will demand difficult choices and careful financial management by the City’s leaders. To this end, we make the following recommendations:\n\nStrengthen the City’s revenues and control ongoing costs.\n\nWhile some revenues have remained strong through the current crisis, others have decreased significantly. It is critical to the City’s recovery that revenue generation and collection be restored. At the same time, we must limit growth in the City’s ongoing costs so that we do not commit to unsustainable levels of future spending.\n\nBuild on successful new programs and consider ending those that are not delivering results.\n\nThe Fiscal Year 2021-22 Budget provides significant funding to begin pilot projects and new programs. The City should analyze these efforts critically and commit to ongoing funding only for those programs which demonstrate success.\n\nMaintain the City’s strong Reserve Fund.\n\nAfter a decade of building up the Reserve Fund, the City used almost $200 million to offset a General Fund shortfall at the end of Fiscal Year 2019-20. Now, with the largest Reserve Fund the City has ever had, there will naturally be a temptation to treat it as a source of funds for new programs. However, these reserves should be guarded and only used to fund the most critically important, one-time programs, or this important tool will not be available the next time it is needed.\n\nUtilize the City’s capital program and debt capacity to meet critical needs and drive equity.\n\nAs part of the effort to reduce expenditures during the first half of Fiscal Year 2020-21, funding was cut from a large number of capital projects. The next budget year will likely see a rebuilding of the City’s capital program, providing a perfect opportunity to leverage capital needs and build equity in the City’s under-resourced and disadvantaged neighborhoods and people.\n\nSCHEDULES I - V\nSCHEDULE I: CASH CONDITION STATEMENT OF RECEIPTS AND DISBURSEMENTS\n\n \n\nSCHEDULE II: RESERVE FUND STATEMENT OF RECEIPTS AND DISBURSEMENTS\n\n \n\nSCHEDULE III: STATEMENT OF RECEIPTS – BUDGET AND ACTUAL (CASH BASIS) – ALL ANNUALLY BUDGETED FUNDS\n\n \n\nSCHEDULE IV: STATEMENT OF BUDGET APPROPRIATIONS, EXPENDITURES AND ENCUMBRANCES BUDGET AND ACTUAL (CASH-BASIS) – ALL ANNUALLY BUDGETED FUNDS\n\n \n\nSCHEDULE V: YEAR-END ENCUMBRANCES – GENERAL FUND\n\n \n\nSCHEDULES VI - X\nSCHEDULE VI: GENERAL FUND UNENCUMBERED BALANCES REVERTED TO THE RESERVE FUND\n\n \n\nSCHEDULE VII: GENERAL FUND YEAR-END UNCOMMITTED BALANCES AND ADOPTED BUDGET REAPPROPRIATIONS\n\n \n\nSCHEDULE VIII: YEAR-END ADVANCES FROM THE RESERVE FUND FOR UNFUNDED EXPENDITURES AND ENCUMBRANCES\n\n \n\nSCHEDULE IX: STATEMENT OF GENERAL OBLIGATION BONDED DEBT\n\n \n\nSCHEDULE X: RATIO OF DEBT SERVICE REQUIREMENT TO GENERAL FUND RECEIPTS LAST TEN FISCAL YEARS\n\n ",

The City’s Reserve Fund Policy sets a goal for the Reserve Fund to be at least 5% of the General Fund budget every year. On July 1, 2021, the Reserve Fund had a balance of $647 million, 8.62% of the General Fund budget and well above the 5% Reserve Fund Policy goal.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Budget Stabilization Fund (BSF) was added to the City Charter in 2011. The purpose of the BSF is to set aside funds when the City exceeds revenue projections to help smooth out years when revenue is stagnant or in decline. In fiscal year 2021, the BSF grew slightly to $118.2 million and is now 1.6% of General Fund revenues.

In early 2022, my office will follow up by issuing the Annual Financial Report for 2020-21, which is prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles and audited by an independent firm of certified public accountants.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Accompanying the PFR are online interactive visualizations with 10 years of data, which can be found at</span> <a href=\"https://lacontroller.org/financial-reports/pfr2021/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">lacontroller.org/pfr2021</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Information on special fund balances and uses, Reserve Fund starting balances over the years, and budget appropriations, adjustments, expenditures and revenues, are also on my website.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The report is prepared to help City leaders understand and assess the state of the City’s finances — an especially important task given that we are still emerging from the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the unique nature of the economic situation, assessing the impact of the pandemic on revenues and expenditures, reserves and outstanding debt — all of which are discussed in the report — along with the assistance provided by the federal government, is critical to navigating the current fiscal year and those ahead.</span></p>\n<p><b>Challenging year until help arrived</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first eight months of the previous fiscal year were months of austerity. Hiring freezes, wage cuts, cancelled capital projects and other money-saving measures were implemented to compensate for a projected $600 million budget shortfall. The last four months of the year brought a reversal of fortunes as help arrived. COVID-19 vaccines became widely available, allowing for a partial economic reopening, and the federal government passed the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (ARPA), which included $1.28 billion in direct funding to the City, half of which was received in May 2021.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other facts about the 2020-21 fiscal year highlighted in the PFR are the following:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Total revenues in budgeted funds were $9.23 billion last year, a 0.7 percent increase over the previous year. This figure does not include ARPA assistance, which helped the City end the year in a cash surplus.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Total expenditures were $8.8 billion, 1.7 percent lower than the year prior, largely because of the City’s hiring freeze and employee sacrifices.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The pandemic underscored how essential reserves are to the City and the need to build them when possible. While they were depleted somewhat during fiscal year 2020-21, the adjusted Reserve Fund balance in July 2021 was $647 million or 8.62 percent of General Fund receipts anticipated in the current budget — higher than it has ever been.&nbsp;</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Difficult decisions loom</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although the PFR reviews last fiscal year’s numbers, which ended solidly thanks to the infusion of ARPA funds, next year could bring different budgeting challenges. One notable issue is the use of one-time ARPA funding, which allowed the creation of most of the new programming in the 2021-22 budget. This funding will not be available to continue these programs in 2022-23, as all of it is spoken for in the current budget — a reality that could force some tough decisions about the continuation of these programs in the next budget. In addition, the current budget includes almost $300 million in programs funded by prior year appropriations, including $70 million reallocated from the Police Department in July 2020. The City needs to thoroughly and honestly assess the performance of these programs over the course of the year to determine which are successful and which fall short of their goals.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another worry is increased expenses in the form of pay and benefits for City employees, many of whom will receive raises soon and see new labor contracts negotiated thereafter. Greater costs could hinder the City’s ability to maintain services, especially if the economy does not rebound as projected. To proactively address these issues, my office recommends that the City focus on increasing revenues where possible and limit spending on novel programs and department requests.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><b>Use capital program and debt financing to promote equity</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The City’s debt service requirements decreased from 5.6 percent to 4.9 percent of General Fund revenues last fiscal year, remaining considerably below the 15 percent policy limit. The significant level of debt capacity presents the City with an opportunity to explore additional debt financing opportunities, which could help create jobs and improve neighborhoods through infrastructure projects. These efforts should benefit areas of Los Angeles that were disproportionately impacted by the pandemic and in historically disadvantaged communities to achieve greater regional equity.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My staff and I appreciate the cooperation shown by City departments as we prepared the PFR.

This Preliminary Financial Report is the first part of that reporting and provides cash basis information on revenues, expenditures, reserves, and bonded indebtedness, including comparisons to the prior year and to the Budget.</p>\n<p>The second part of this reporting requirement is the Annual Financial Report (AFR), the City’s official, audited financial statement, which will be released later this fiscal year. Together, these two documents educate and inform both City decision-makers and the public on the City’s financial position.</p>\n<p><strong>A Year of Uncertainty </strong></p>\n<p>Fiscal year 2020-21 began in a state of widespread uncertainty. The nation was three months into the COVID-19 pandemic with stay-at-home emergency orders in place. The impact the pandemic would have on the City’s economy was unknown, and the potential for assistance from the federal government was unclear. Due to this uncertainty, the City Council did not revise the Mayor’s Proposed Budget as it usually does, but left it instead to become “the official budget” in accordance with the City Charter, acknowledging that revisions would be necessary throughout the year. By the end of June 2020, it was clear that the financial and social landscape had already changed, and the Council passed significant budget amendments on July 1.</p>\n<p>For the first eight months of the Fiscal Year, the City operated in an environment of austerity. Hiring freezes, mandatory budget reductions, amended labor contracts, deferral or cancellation of capital projects, and a Separation Incentive Plan were all implemented in order to mitigate what was at one point projected to be a revenue shortfall of more than $600 million.</p>\n<p>The final third of the Fiscal Year saw a reversal of fortunes. COVID-19 vaccines became widely available, allowing for a partial economic reopening. The federal government passed the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (ARPA), which included direct funding to the City of almost $1.3 billion, half of which was received in May 2021. Other grants and funding streams from the federal and state governments were also approved bringing much-needed funding for COVID-19 and homelessness response efforts. Fortunately, an uneven economic recovery resulted in General Fund revenues performing better than feared, finishing the year only $317 million below budget.</p>\n<p>Combining improved revenues with savings from nine months of hiring freezes and budget cuts, the General Fund ended the year with an unexpectedly large surplus to transfer to the Reserve Fund, which resulted in Fiscal Year 2021-22 starting with a record-high balance of $640 million, $385 million more than twelve months earlier.</p>\n<p>The Fiscal Year 2021-22 Budget was adopted with a framework of economic and social recovery, and the second tranche of the ARPA funds and other funding sources were programmed to finance more than $900 million in homelessness response and equity programs. The Budget projects a strong rebound, with 7.7 percent growth in General Fund revenue, not including the ARPA funding. While it is still too early to make accurate projections, the first three months of this Fiscal Year have shown signs of growth.</p>\n<p>However, the future will bring significant challenges. Most of the new programming contained in the Fiscal Year 2021-22 Budget is backed by one-time funding which means these new programs will not continue in 2022-23 unless additional funding is identified. In addition, many City employees are due to receive a deferred pay increase at the end of the current Fiscal Year (June 30, 2022), after which most of the City’s Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs) expire. The collective bargaining process that will follow will likely lead to additional long-term obligatory costs, especially as predictions of cost inflation begin to impact decision-making. There are also approximately $300 million in programs in the current year that are funded from prior year appropriations, including almost $70 million in funding that was reallocated from the Police Department in July 2020.</p>\n<p>The combination of the cessation of one-time monies, new programs and priorities, and labor negotiations means that the Fiscal Year 2022-23 budget process will inevitably require difficult choices and trade-offs. A renewed Reserve Fund may provide some limited ability to defer these decisions or fund individual projects, but doing so would substantially weaken the City’s ability to weather future economic crises without another round of destabilizing cuts.</p>\n<p><strong>Recommendations</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Strengthen the City’s revenues and control ongoing costs.</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>While some revenues have remained strong through the current crisis, others have decreased significantly. It is critical to the City’s recovery that revenue generation and collection be restored. At the same time, we must limit growth in the City’s ongoing costs so that we do not commit to unsustainable levels of future spending.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong>Build on successful new programs and consider ending those that are not delivering results.</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>The Fiscal Year 2021-22 Budget provides significant funding to begin pilot projects and new programs. The City should analyze these efforts critically and commit to ongoing funding only for those programs which demonstrate success.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><strong>Maintain the City’s strong Reserve Fund.</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>After a decade of building up the Reserve Fund, the City used almost $200 million to offset a General Fund shortfall at the end of Fiscal Year 2019-20. Now, with the largest Reserve Fund the City has ever had, there will naturally be a temptation to treat it as a source of funds for new programs. However, these reserves should be guarded and only used to fund the most critically important, one-time programs, or this important tool will not be available the next time it is needed.</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li><strong>Utilize the City’s capital program and debt capacity to meet critical needs and drive equity.</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>As part of the effort to reduce expenditures during the first half of Fiscal Year 2020-21, funding was cut from a large number of capital projects. The next budget year will likely see a rebuilding of the City’s capital program, providing a perfect opportunity to leverage capital needs and building equity in the City’s under-resourced and disadvantaged neighborhoods. The City should consider capital projects as another method of reorienting the City’s built environment to benefit historically disadvantaged neighborhoods and people.</p>\n<p>The Preliminary Financial Report is organized in four distinct sections:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Revenues and Expenditures</strong></span>: A discussion of the fiscal year that just ended, including trend analysis, notable changes from prior years, and financial performance relative to the Budget;</li>\n<li><strong><u>Reserve Fund</u></strong><u>:</u> A discussion of the current condition of the City’s Reserve Fund, and analysis of the various factors influencing that figure;</li>\n<li><strong><u>Budget Stabilization Fund</u></strong>: A discussion of the Fund policy and how actual figures compare to the policy; and</li>\n<li><strong><u>Bonded Indebtedness</u></strong>: A statement of the City’s total bonded indebtedness and debt service requirements; as well as comparisons to City policies and legal limitations.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong><u>Revenues and Expenditures</u></strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Total Budgeted Revenue was 6.8 percent below the Budget, growing by 0.7 percent over Fiscal Year 2019-20, and 1.6 percent over Fiscal Year 2018-19. General Fund revenue fell by 0.1 percent compared to last year, and was 4.8 percent below the Budget. Significant shortfalls in Transient Occupancy Tax, Sales Tax, Parking Users’ Tax, Departmental Receipts, the Special Parking Revenue Fund transfer, and Parking Fines were partially offset by healthy growth in Property Tax, strong growth in Documentary Transfer Tax, and one-time revenue from federal grants. Revenue in budgeted special funds increased by 2.4 percent over the prior year; however, it was 11.0 percent under the budget due to shortfalls in building permit revenues, State Proposition A revenues, and a delay in Sewer Construction and Maintenance Fund bond issuance. Receipts from the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (ARPA) are not included in Budgeted Revenue because the funds were not included in the 2020-21 Budget and the receipts were transferred to the General Fund as cash and not appropriated for spending.</p>\n<p>Both expenditures and encumbrances declined, 1.7 and 33.7 percent respectively, from June 30, 2020 to June 30, 2021. While all of the categories of spending dropped, the Capital Improvement Expenditure Program contracted the most, followed by Liability Claims, and Proposition A Local Transit Assistance.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong><u>Reserve Fund</u></strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>The Reserve Fund served its purpose in Fiscal Year 2019-20, when it absorbed the $195.5 million General Fund revenue shortfall. The City also front-funded pandemic related costs using reserves. As a result, the Reserve Fund Balance started Fiscal Year 2020-21 at just 3.9 percent of the General Fund Budget, below the 5 percent policy goal. However, due to the combination of ARPA funds, fourth quarter revenue growth, and reduced General Fund expenditures, the Reserve Fund began Fiscal Year 2021-22 at 8.62 percent of the General Fund Budget.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><strong><u>Budget Stabilization Fund</u></strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>The Budget Stabilization Fund (BSF) is the City’s mechanism for accumulating excess tax revenues in growth years in order to mitigate shortfalls in lean years. During the year, the BSF was proposed to be used as part of the budget balancing solution. However, as it turned out, such action was unnecessary, and the June 30, 2021 balance in the Fund was $118.2 million.</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li><strong><u>Bonded Indebtedness</u></strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Bonded indebtedness and the City’s debt service obligations decreased due to the defeasance and advance refunding of MICLA Revenue Bonds Series 2014 and 2019 and the lack of any large new issuance of General Obligation Bonds. Debt service payments decreased as well, from 5.6 percent to 4.9 percent of General Fund revenue, and are well under the City’s 15 percent policy ceiling.</p>\n</div></div></div><div class=\"panel panel-default\"><div class=\"panel-heading active-accordion\"><a data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-parent=\"#1602779190\" href=\"#accordian-panel-3\"><h4 class=\"panel-title\">Section I: Revenues and Expenditures<span class=\"pull-right\"><i class=\"fas fa-minus\"></i></span></h4></a></div><div id=\"accordian-panel-3\" class=\"panel-collapse collapse in\" style=\"\"><div class=\"panel-body\"><p>Total revenues in budgeted funds for 2020-21 were $9.23 billion, an increase of 0.7 percent compared to 2019-20, and increase of 1.6 percent over 2018-19.

Over the past five years, General Fund revenue averaged 3.9 percent growth, slightly exceeding the Budget twice and coming up a little short three times. In Fiscal Year 2020-21, General Fund revenue decreased from the prior year, the first time this occurred in more than a decade.

Ex-CRA Property Tax Increment revenue was $32.1 million over the budget and $44.0 million more than the prior year.</p>\n<p>The Budget assumed 4.5 percent growth for Business Tax receipts, and actual receipts were 5.6 percent or $36.5 million higher than last year, and 0.9 percent or $5.8 million over the Budget. Recreational cannabis Business Tax generated $136.8 million in revenues, and its share in the total Business Tax grew from 11.9 percent to 19.8 percent. Actual receipts exceeded the Budget by $37.5 million (37.7 percent), and exceeded last year’s total by $58.5 million (74.7 percent). Meanwhile non-cannabis Business Tax actual receipts of $555.6 million were 5.4 percent or $31.6 million lower than the Budget, and 3.8 percent or $22.0 million lower than last year.</p>\n<p>Sales Tax Receipts were $31.6 million or 5.7 percent lower than last year, and $32.4 million or 5.8 percent lower than the Budget. Along with pandemic-related closures, the Tax Deferment Program implemented by the State affected the collected revenues. Due to lack of detailed data, it is virtually impossible to differentiate these two impacts, so we do not know how much of the reduced receipts will be recovered in future periods.</p>\n<p>Franchise Income ended higher than Budget by $3.1 million, mainly due to Natural Gas Franchise income that exceeded the Budget by $2.4 million.</p>\n<p>Utility Users’ Tax was 0.1 percent below the Budget, and 3.6 percent lower than last year’s actual receipts. While Gas Users Tax exceeded the Budget by $6.4 million, Electrical Users and Telephone Users Taxes were a combined $5.7 million (1.0 percent) under the Budget.</p>\n<p>Licenses, Permits, Fees and Fines ended $77.8 million or 5.8 percent lower than the Budget, but higher than last year ($59.2 million or 4.9 percent). The picture would have been significantly worse without the $125 million reimbursement of City Expenditures from COVID-19 Federal Relief Fund. Departmental receipts (relating mainly to licenses, permits, and various service fees collected by departments) were $11.9 million below the budgeted amounts. Other components of Licenses, Permits, Fees and Fines were short as well (Emergency Ambulance Services $21.0 million, Services to the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (LACMTA) $27.9 million, and Services to Proprietary Departments 26.9 million). The shortfall in reimbursements from special funds, excluding the COVID-19 Federal Relief Fund transfer, was $115.1 million.</p>\n<p>As a result of the March 22, 2020, Federal Major Disaster Declaration related to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Public Assistance program will reimburse state and local governments for pandemic-related emergency protective measures. The City has applied for, and FEMA has approved, this assistance for the City. As a result, the City received $30.7 million in Fiscal Year 2020-21 and will receive additional reimbursements in future years.</p>\n<p>Transient Occupancy Tax (TOT, commonly known as Hotel Tax) receipts experienced the most conspicuous decline, as travel and hospitality virtually stopped. TOT was $134.4 million or 54.9 percent below budget and $143.1 million or 56.5 percent less than last year. Receipts near the end of Fiscal Year 2020-21 and the beginning of the current fiscal year have shown some growth, but still far below pre-COVID levels.</p>\n<p>Exhibit 4 shows cumulative Transient Occupancy Tax monthly receipts for FY 2019, FY 2020 and FY 2021.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-6363\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%202158%201063'%3E%3C/svg%3E\" alt=\"\" width=\"2158\" height=\"1063\" data-lazy-srcset=\"https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/lacontroller-2b7de.appspot.com/o/photos%2F2022%2FPFR2021_Exhibit4.png?alt=media&token=0b5301f4-10f4-427a-9e2d-a02905e644a4 2158w, https://lacontroller.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/PFR2021_Exhibit4-300x148.png 300w, https://lacontroller.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/PFR2021_Exhibit4-1024x504.png 1024w, https://lacontroller.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/PFR2021_Exhibit4-768x378.png 768w, https://lacontroller.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/PFR2021_Exhibit4-1536x757.png 1536w, https://lacontroller.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/PFR2021_Exhibit4-2048x1009.png 2048w, https://lacontroller.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/PFR2021_Exhibit4-81x40.png 81w\" data-lazy-sizes=\"(max-width: 2158px) 100vw, 2158px\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/lacontroller-2b7de.appspot.com/o/photos%2F2022%2FPFR2021_Exhibit4.png?alt=media&token=0b5301f4-10f4-427a-9e2d-a02905e644a4\"><noscript><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-6363\" src=\"https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/lacontroller-2b7de.appspot.com/o/photos%2F2022%2FPFR2021_Exhibit4.png?alt=media&token=0b5301f4-10f4-427a-9e2d-a02905e644a4\" alt=\"\" width=\"2158\" height=\"1063\" srcset=\"https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/lacontroller-2b7de.appspot.com/o/photos%2F2022%2FPFR2021_Exhibit4.png?alt=media&token=0b5301f4-10f4-427a-9e2d-a02905e644a4 2158w, https://lacontroller.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/PFR2021_Exhibit4-300x148.png 300w, https://lacontroller.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/PFR2021_Exhibit4-1024x504.png 1024w, https://lacontroller.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/PFR2021_Exhibit4-768x378.png 768w, https://lacontroller.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/PFR2021_Exhibit4-1536x757.png 1536w, https://lacontroller.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/PFR2021_Exhibit4-2048x1009.png 2048w, https://lacontroller.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/PFR2021_Exhibit4-81x40.png 81w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2158px) 100vw, 2158px\" /></noscript></p>\n<p>The pandemic’s impact on the lodging industry will likely continue to evolve, rather than disappear.

Even as priorities have shifted and the economy has expanded, this percentage has remained remarkably stable.</p>\n<p>Also of note were the contributions to the City’s pension systems, which totaled $1.43 billion, 15.3 percent of total spending. This is up slightly from the prior year. To the extent that the City is able to hold salary expenditures under long-term averages, the increase will be mitigated, but this issue should be monitored carefully.</p>\n<p>The City ended the Fiscal Year with a total of $516.4 million in encumbrances: &nbsp;$356.8 million in the General Fund and $159.5 million in special funds, $110.9 million was encumbered for salaries to be paid in July 2021, with the balance encumbered in expense, equipment, and special fund project accounts.</p>\n<p>Encumbered funds for salaries are earmarked for the last pay period of the fiscal year and unspent funds are immediately released after payroll is made. Funds encumbered for expense accounts are continued across fiscal years to ensure that cash is available to cover the expenditure when it is made. Schedule V provides a listing of General Fund encumbrances by department.</p>\n<p>The General Fund Encumbrance Policy provides that encumbered funds that remain unspent for a period longer than one Fiscal Year shall be disencumbered every fiscal year, with the exception of capital project funds. &nbsp;Prior-year encumbrances are automatically disencumbered unless exempted by Mayor and Council approval. As part of the 2020-21 Year-End Financial Status Report, a total of $53.0 million was exempted from being disencumbered, a decrease of $4.1 million from last year’s exemptions. As noted in past years, this is an issue which deserves more attention.</p>\n<p>Unencumbered General funds revert to the Reserve Fund at year end. As such, exemptions to the automatic disencumbrance policy reduce reversions, thereby reducing the cash available in the Reserve Fund to pay for emergencies and contingencies. Section II below discusses the status of the Reserve Fund in more detail.</p>\n</div></div></div><div class=\"panel panel-default\"><div class=\"panel-heading active-accordion\"><a data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-parent=\"#1602779190\" href=\"#accordian-panel-4\"><h4 class=\"panel-title\">Section II: Reserve Fund<span class=\"pull-right\"><i class=\"fas fa-minus\"></i></span></h4></a></div><div id=\"accordian-panel-4\" class=\"panel-collapse collapsing\" style=\"height: 5569px;\"><div class=\"panel-body\"><p>The Reserve Fund is established to ensure that funds are available for unanticipated expenditures and revenue shortfalls in the General Fund, and is broken into an Emergency Account and a Contingency Account.</p>\n<p>The Emergency Reserve Account is fixed at 2.75 percent of the adopted General Fund receipts.

This was $137.2 million more than the amount anticipated in the 2021-22 Budget. The Reserve Fund cash balance is adjusted by the following factors to arrive at the year-end balance:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><u>Balance Before Year-End Reversions/Borrowings</u></li>\n</ol>\n<p>The amount of cash available in the Contingency Reserve prior to adjustments for year-end reversions, unallocated revenues, and borrowings. It does not include cash in the Emergency Reserve. For 2020-21, this amount was higher than anticipated in the budget due to higher than anticipated return of advances and early reversion made after the adoption of the budget.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><u>Reversion of Uncommitted Balances</u></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Uncommitted General Fund appropriations are reverted to the Reserve Fund at fiscal year-end. Appropriations (spending authority) granted to City departments by the Mayor and Council are committed throughout the year in the form of encumbrances and expenditures. Remaining or uncommitted balances are reverted to the Reserve Fund to the extent that there is available cash in the General Fund.</p>\n<p>In 2020-21, the budget estimated $386.1 million in reversions. The uncommitted balance at year end was $418.3 million. Excluding unfunded appropriations, a total of $279.3 million reverted to the Reserve Fund. For a detailed breakdown of uncommitted balances by department, please see Schedule VII.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><u>Year-End Unallocated Revenue </u></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Unallocated revenue occurs when revenues exceed the total budget appropriation. At Fiscal Year-end, excess receipts of $295.7 million reverted to the Reserve Fund as unallocated revenue. The 2021-22 Adopted Budget anticipated $45.9 million in unallocated revenue. Actual receipts were $249.8 million more than the budgeted unallocated revenue.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><u>Advances Under CF 20-0600-S91</u></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Council File 20-0600-S91 authorized the Controller to borrow from the Reserve Fund at year-end to balance departmental budgets where needed in order to facilitate the closing of the City’s General Ledger. The Controller is authorized to increase appropriations within established limits without getting itemized Mayor and Council approval, a process that would delay the closing of the City’s General Ledger. Advances were made to Fire and Personnel Departments in the amount of $83,320 and $21,913 respectively.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><u>Advances Under Charter Section 261(i) for Unfunded Encumbrances and Expenditures</u></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Under Charter Section 261(i), the Controller transfers funds from the Reserve Fund as a loan to any fund that becomes depleted due to tardy receipt of revenue. The 2021-22 Budget estimated $50.0 million in year-end advances. Actual advances were $49.6 million, consisting of $35.3 million in unfunded expenditures and $14.3 million in unfunded encumbrances. See Schedule VIII for a breakdown by department.</p>\n<p>Unfunded expenditures generally occur when transactions take place prior to receipt of funding (e.g. grants on reimbursement basis) and/or due to billing delays. When the funding source reimburses the costs, departments are able to repay the advances. If funding is not available, departments may request Mayor and Council approval to write-off the advances.

Such an investment would also provide an opportunity to focus on regional equity, focusing investment in areas of the City which have often been left behind in prior initiatives.

This period will feature political transitions as well as economic transitions. The City’s immediate fiscal position is strong, but the many critical priorities and limited ongoing funding will demand difficult choices and careful financial management by the City’s leaders. To this end, we make the following recommendations:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Strengthen the City’s revenues and control ongoing costs.</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>While some revenues have remained strong through the current crisis, others have decreased significantly. It is critical to the City’s recovery that revenue generation and collection be restored. At the same time, we must limit growth in the City’s ongoing costs so that we do not commit to unsustainable levels of future spending.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong>Build on successful new programs and consider ending those that are not delivering results.</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>The Fiscal Year 2021-22 Budget provides significant funding to begin pilot projects and new programs. The City should analyze these efforts critically and commit to ongoing funding only for those programs which demonstrate success.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><strong>Maintain the City’s strong Reserve Fund.</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>After a decade of building up the Reserve Fund, the City used almost $200 million to offset a General Fund shortfall at the end of Fiscal Year 2019-20. Now, with the largest Reserve Fund the City has ever had, there will naturally be a temptation to treat it as a source of funds for new programs. However, these reserves should be guarded and only used to fund the most critically important, one-time programs, or this important tool will not be available the next time it is needed.</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li><strong>Utilize the City’s capital program and debt capacity to meet critical needs and drive equity.</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>As part of the effort to reduce expenditures during the first half of Fiscal Year 2020-21, funding was cut from a large number of capital projects. The next budget year will likely see a rebuilding of the City’s capital program, providing a perfect opportunity to leverage capital needs and build equity in the City’s under-resourced and disadvantaged neighborhoods and people.</p>\n</div></div></div><div class=\"panel panel-default\"><div class=\"panel-heading active-accordion\"><a data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-parent=\"#1602779190\"

Although forecasts inherently involve uncertainty — as exemplified by the experience of the past 12 months — this report offers estimates based on the available information and seeks to promote practical and responsible budgeting in the year ahead. Also included in the report are the estimated requirements for debt service and General Fund cash flow borrowing.\n\nUse the dashboard below to explore actual receipts for last year, FY20, projected revenues and their sources for FY21 and 22, and compare last year’s budgeted and actual revenues to the estimates for this and next fiscal year.\n\nRevenue\nFY 2021\n\nThe City’s adopted budget this fiscal year, FY21, totals $10.53 billion. Two-thirds of that, $6.68 billion, consists of General Fund revenues, while the rest, $3.85 billion, comes from hundreds of special purpose funds and available balances. The updated estimate of General Fund receipts for the current fiscal year is $6.14 billion, 8.3% lower than the budgeted amount and 3.7% below the last fiscal year. This means the General Fund will have a $549 million revenue shortfall. Property tax revenues likely will increase by 6.1% and cannabis business taxes by 79% ($139 million), but will be offset by dramatic shortfalls in transient occupancy tax (down 66%), parking occupancy tax (down 44%), and telephone users tax (down 15%) receipts, among others. \n\nFY 2022\n\nWhile the economy remains unsettled given the ongoing public health crisis, based on the widening availability of vaccines, the Controller’s Office is cautiously optimistic that the overall economic recovery could start slowly this summer around the beginning of FY22, which would also lead to an uptick in City revenues. \n\nGeneral Fund receipts for FY22 are projected to be $6.4 billion, an increase of 4.4% over FY21 estimates. The revenues growing in the current year should continue to increase, along with 5.8% growth in business tax receipts and a 6.7% increase in sales tax receipts. Transient occupancy tax receipts are likely to increase in the second half of FY22, but will remain well below pre-pandemic levels. This revenue category has been hit the hardest by COVID-19 as travel and hospitality slowed to a near stop once the pandemic took hold, and is expected to take the longest to recover.\n\nThis chart breaks down total City revenues in all categories (General Fund and special funds) from 2010 to 2020, along with revenue projections for this fiscal year and the next. Filter by category or by name of revenue source.\n\nAlthough the Controller’s Office is not assuming an overly aggressive timetable for economic recovery, it is entirely possible that the recovery may not happen that quickly. If the pandemic worsens in the coming months, next year’s revenues could come in lower, perhaps considerably lower, than projected in this forecast. However, despite a year of uncertainty, the available local and national data give reason for encouragement. More stabilization in the local economy leading to eventual upward trends is quite feasible in the coming months, provided the pandemic continues to subside. If that comes to pass, recovery will be a long and winding road, but steady growth should happen over the course of FY22. \n\nAnother factor that looms large when discussing the City’s recovery is the prospective infusion of additional federal and state relief funds, which would bolster L.A.’s coffers considerably. Under the current plan before Congress, the City could receive more than $1.2 billion to replace lost revenue, protect core services and assist with pandemic response efforts. Because this relief funding has not yet been secured, it is not included in these revenue projections.\n\nEven with external funding the end of this fiscal year will be tough and troubling for the City’s finances, making the coming budget process even more difficult than the last. Despite the very real prospect of recovery in FY22, no promises can be made at this time, only projections based on the economic and public health information at the City’s disposal. For this reason, the City must go into this budget season with a careful, deliberate eye on maintaining services to the extent possible during this trying time.\n\nDebt\n\nThe estimated City debt service requirement for fiscal year 2022 is $568.1 million, including $119.3 million is for principal and interest payments on the City’s $772 million in outstanding General Obligation Bonds. In total, debt service is projected to be 4.97 percent of projected 2021-22 General Fund receipts, well under the 15 percent limit set by the City’s Debt Policy.\n\nDownload the data\n\nClick here to download the City’s revenue data on our Open Data portal.",

Two-thirds of that, $6.68 billion, consists of General Fund revenues, while the rest, $3.85 billion, comes from hundreds of special purpose funds and available balances. The updated estimate of General Fund receipts for the current fiscal year is $6.14 billion, 8.3% lower than the budgeted amount and 3.7% below the last fiscal year. This means the General Fund will have a $549 million revenue shortfall. Property tax revenues likely will increase by 6.1% and cannabis business taxes by 79% ($139 million), but will be offset by dramatic shortfalls in transient occupancy tax (down 66%), parking occupancy tax (down 44%), and telephone users tax (down 15%) receipts, among others.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h2>FY 2022</h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the economy remains unsettled given the ongoing public health crisis, based on the widening availability of vaccines, the Controller’s Office is cautiously optimistic that the overall economic recovery could start slowly this summer around the beginning of FY22, which would also lead to an uptick in City revenues.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">General Fund receipts for FY22 are projected to be $6.4 billion, an increase of 4.4% over FY21 estimates. The revenues growing in the current year should continue to increase, along with 5.8% growth in business tax receipts and a 6.7% increase in sales tax receipts. Transient occupancy tax receipts are likely to increase in the second half of FY22, but will remain well below pre-pandemic levels. This revenue category has been hit the hardest by COVID-19 as travel and hospitality slowed to a near stop once the pandemic took hold, and is expected to take the longest to recover.</span></p>\n<p>This chart breaks down total City revenues in all categories (General Fund and special funds) from 2010 to 2020, along with revenue projections for this fiscal year and the next.

If the pandemic worsens in the coming months, next year’s revenues could come in lower, perhaps considerably lower, than projected in this forecast. However, despite a year of uncertainty, the available local and national data give reason for encouragement. More stabilization in the local economy leading to eventual upward trends is quite feasible in the coming months, provided the pandemic continues to subside. If that comes to pass, recovery will be a long and winding road, but steady growth should happen over the course of FY22.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another factor that looms large when discussing the City’s recovery is the prospective infusion of additional federal and state relief funds, which would bolster L.A.’s coffers considerably. Under the current plan before Congress, the City could receive more than $1.2 billion to replace lost revenue, protect core services and assist with pandemic response efforts. Because this relief funding has not yet been secured, it is not included in these revenue projections.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even with external funding the end of this fiscal year will be tough and troubling for the City’s finances, making the coming budget process even more difficult than the last. Despite the very real prospect of recovery in FY22, no promises can be made at this time, only projections based on the economic and public health information at the City’s disposal. For this reason, the City must go into this budget season with a careful, deliberate eye on maintaining services to the extent possible during this trying time.</span></p>\n<hr>\n<h1>Debt</h1>\n<p>The estimated City debt service requirement for fiscal year 2022 is $568.1 million, including $119.3 million is for principal and interest payments on the City’s $772 million in outstanding General Obligation Bonds. In total, debt service is projected to be 4.97 percent of projected 2021-22 General Fund receipts, well under the 15 percent limit set by the City’s Debt Policy.</p>\n<div id=\"viz1614272586366\" class=\"tableauPlaceholder\" style=\"position: relative; width: 100%; height: 576.75px; overflow: hidden; display: block;\"><noscript><a href='#'><img alt=' ' src='https://public.tableau.com/static/images/Re/RevenueForecastFY22/UpdatedDebt/1_rss.png' style='border: none' /></a></noscript><script src=\"https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js\"></script><object class=\"tableauViz\" style=\"display: none; width: 100%; height: 576.75px;\" width=\"300\" height=\"150\"><param name=\"host_url\" value=\"https%3A%2F%2Fpublic.tableau.com%2F\"><param name=\"embed_code_version\" value=\"3\"><param name=\"site_root\" value=\"\"><param name=\"name\" value=\"RevenueForecastFY22/UpdatedDebt\"><param name=\"tabs\" value=\"no\"><param name=\"toolbar\" value=\"yes\"><param name=\"static_image\" value=\"https://public.tableau.com/static/images/Re/RevenueForecastFY22/UpdatedDebt/1.png\"><param name=\"animate_transition\" value=\"yes\"><param name=\"display_static_image\" value=\"yes\"><param name=\"display_spinner\" value=\"yes\"><param name=\"display_overlay\" value=\"yes\"><param name=\"display_count\" value=\"yes\"><param name=\"language\" value=\"en\"></object><div style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;right:0;bottom:0;border:0;padding:0;margin:0\"><div style=\"top:100px;left:0;right:0;position:absolute;z-index:991;box-shadow:none;display:flex;justify-content:center;\"><style>#tableau-svg-spinner-container-2{width:65px;height:65px;border-radius:10px;display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center}#tableau-svg-spinner-2{width:50px;height:50px;-webkit-animation:tableau-svg-spinner-animation 1s linear infinite;animation:tableau-svg-spinner-animation 1s linear infinite}@-webkit-keyframes tableau-svg-spinner-animation{100%{-webkit-transform:rotate(360deg)}}@keyframes tableau-svg-spinner-animation{100%{transform:rotate(360deg)}}</style><div id=\"tableau-svg-spinner-container-2\"><svg id=\"tableau-svg-spinner-2\" viewBox=\"0 0 50 50\"><style>#tail{fill:url(#tableau-fade-2)}#head{fill:#616570}stop{stop-color:#616570}</style><linearGradient id=\"tableau-fade-2\" x2=\"50\" y1=\"25\" y2=\"25\" gradientUnits=\"userSpaceOnUse\"><stop offset=\"0\" stop-opacity=\"0\"></stop><stop offset=\".15\" stop-opacity=\".04\"></stop><stop offset=\".3\" stop-opacity=\".16\"></stop><stop offset=\".45\" stop-opacity=\".36\"></stop><stop offset=\".61\" stop-opacity=\".64\"></stop><stop offset=\".76\"></stop></linearGradient><path id=\"head\" d=\"M0 25a25 25 0 1 0 50 0h-3.9a21.1 21.1 0 1 1-42.2 0\"></path><path id=\"tail\" d=\"M50 25a25 25 0 0 0-50 0h3.9a21.1 21.1 0 1 1 42.2 0\"></path></svg></div></div><div style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;right:0;bottom:0;z-index:990;background-color:#EBEBEB;opacity:.24\"></div><style>#tableau-svg-spinner-container-2{border-radius:12px;background:rgba(255,255,255,.6);</style><div style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; right: 0; bottom: 0; background: transparent url('https://public.tableau.com/static/images/Re/RevenueForecastFY22/UpdatedDebt/1.png?height=577&amp;width=769&amp;deviceScaleFactor=1') no-repeat scroll 0 0; background-size: 769px 577px; box-shadow: none; left:0px; top:1px\"></div></div><iframe frameborder=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" title=\"데이터 비주얼리제이션\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" class=\"tableauViz\" style=\"display: block; width: 100%; height: 576.75px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: none;\" width=\"300\" height=\"150\"></iframe></div>\n<p><script type=\"text/javascript\">                    var divElement = document.getElementById('viz1614272586366');                    var vizElement = divElement.getElementsByTagName('object')[0];                    if ( divElement.offsetWidth > 800 ) { vizElement.style.width='100%';vizElement.style.height=(divElement.offsetWidth*0.75)+'px';} else if ( divElement.offsetWidth > 500 ) { vizElement.style.width='100%';vizElement.style.height=(divElement.offsetWidth*0.75)+'px';} else { vizElement.style.width='100%';vizElement.style.height='827px';}                     var scriptElement = document.createElement('script');                    scriptElement.src = 'https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js';                    vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement);                </script></p>\n<hr>\n<h1>Download the data</h1>\n<p><a href=\"https://controllerdata.lacity.org/Budget/Revenue-Budget-and-Receipts/6cbx-e2fd/data\">Click here to download the City’s revenue data on our Open Data portal.</a></p>\n</div>"

Each year, my office produces the Annual Financial Report, which gives a complete financial picture of the City, including revenues, expenditures, assets and liabilities. The AFR, along with the City’s Annual Budget and the City Administrative Officer’s financial status reports, is fundamental to understanding the City’s financial opportunities and challenges. On this page is the more accessible version of the report, the Popular Annual Financial Report, which presents the data in an easier-to-read format so that everyone can understand the finances of the City.</p>\n<p>Here’s a snapshot of the City’s finances for Fiscal Year 2020 (FY20):</p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Overall <strong>City revenues decreased by 4%</strong> to $17.5 billion, in contrast with FY19 when L.A. experienced 13.7% revenue growth. The change is attributable to the pandemic and its immediate impact on trade, tourism and tax revenues.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">The story was slightly different looking just at the <strong>General Fund</strong>, the City’s main operating fund, which saw a 1.9% increase over the year prior. However, General Fund revenues in the first six months of the current fiscal year are down 10.8% or $254 million — significantly lower than the same period in FY20. How much they will continue to suffer depends on how quickly the economy can begin to reopen safely and recover.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Overall <strong>City expenses shot up by 9.9% to $16.5</strong> billion, with General Fund expenses up by 7.3%. The cost of salaries and benefits increased by $253 million and retirement contributions by $88 million over FY19. The City’s three pension systems saw just a 3% return in FY20, but are collectively 85% funded. The trend of rising expenses has continued in the first six months of the current fiscal year, with General Fund expenditures up 1.4% or $43 million over FY20, largely due to COVID-19 response activities, some of which are eligible for reimbursement.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">The <strong>City’s net position</strong> is $24.1 billion, a 3.9% increase over the year prior.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Until the fourth quarter of FY20, the City had experienced nearly eight consecutive years of relatively strong economic growth and an uptick in revenues. The rapid onset of the COVID-19 pandemic halted that trend almost immediately — which is reflected in the precipitous drop in some economically sensitive revenue streams for that quarter.</p>\n<p>What actions should Los Angeles take to stabilize its finances? Here are some that would help:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Pursue federal and state funding:</strong> The City should vigorously pursue additional federal and state funding to protect core services and assist with ongoing pandemic response efforts, while seeking to maximize the effectiveness of the outside assistance already received, but not yet spent.</li>\n<li><strong>Use special funds to lessen pandemic pain:</strong> The City relies on 700+ special purpose funds to maintain parks, build affordable housing, pick up trash and more. The balance of these funds has grown to $5.1 billion and the City should do more to utilize the funds that are sitting idle or rarely used. Millions could be repurposed to bolster the City’s bottom line and meet community needs.</li>\n<li><strong>Focus on revenue and limit spending:</strong> While tourism-related revenues dropped, the City must work harder to collect from its other revenue streams and continue working with stakeholders to defer expenses where possible.</li>\n<li><strong>Rebuild the Reserve Fund:</strong> To balance the FY20 budget, the City transferred nearly $200 million from its reserves to the General Fund. With plans already being made to further deplete the Reserve Fund to balance the current budget, the task of rebuilding it will become even more critical.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In keeping with my commitment to transparency and accountability, this report also features charts and graphs that measure the performance of City departments and functions, which help elucidate how well Los Angeles is using its finances to serve the public year over year.</p>\n<p>Our goals are to educate Angelenos on City finances and empower them to be better advocates for their communities.

Tourism and hospitality, professional and business services, international trade, entertainment production, and wholesale trade and logistics all contribute significantly to local employment. The Port of Los Angeles handles the largest volume of containerized cargo of all U.S. ports and is top in cargo value for U.S. waterborne foreign traffic. Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) is the third busiest airport in the world in terms of total number of passengers, and is 13th in the world in air cargo tonnage.</p>\n<p>The City’s economy was thrust into recession in March 2020, along with the rest of the nation and much of the world, due to the COVID-19 virus and the various orders intended to slow the spread of the virus. Large sectors of the economy were severely curtailed, with the biggest reduction coming in tourism and hospitality. After falling to 4.3 percent in the first half of the fiscal year, the unemployment rate in Los Angeles County jumped to 21.1 percent by May 2020. Since that time, unemployment has slowly decreased, down to 11 percent in November 2020.</p>\n<p>City government has initiated a number of programs aimed at mitigating the economic damage the pandemic has caused, including emergency rental assistance, meal distribution, expansion of temporary living facilities for chronically homeless residents, small business loans and grants, free childcare, and other services.</p>\n<p>Widespread vaccine administration began in January 2021, giving the economy has reason for hope. However, recent trends with the virus have resulted in increased restrictions and restricted economic activity. The balance of these two trends will determine the direction of the economy over the next six to 12 months.</p>\n<div class=\"jsx-1246325250 grid-item \">\n<p><strong>Fast facts about the City of Los Angeles:</strong></p>\n<ul class=\"text-viewer text-viewer-bullet-list\">\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Population: </strong>4 million residents; 1.3 million households (defined as people living in the same house, apartment or living quarters)</li>\n<li><strong>Ethnic makeup:</strong> 48.6% Latino, 28.5% white, 11.8% Asian/Pacific Islander, 9% Black, 1.4% American Indian/Others</li>\n<li><strong>Size:</strong> 468.7 square miles of land</li>\n<li><strong>Median household income: </strong>$58,385</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"vc_empty_space\" style=\"height: 32px\"><span class=\"vc_empty_space_inner\"></span></div></div></div><div class=\"vc_tta-panel\" id=\"1579290472674-9147d917-ede3\" data-vc-content=\".vc_tta-panel-body\"><div class=\"vc_tta-panel-heading\"><h4 class=\"vc_tta-panel-title vc_tta-controls-icon-position-left\"><a href=\"#1579290472674-9147d917-ede3\" data-vc-accordion=\"\" data-vc-container=\".vc_tta-container\"><span class=\"vc_tta-title-text\">City Organization</span><i class=\"vc_tta-controls-icon vc_tta-controls-icon-plus\"></i></a></h4></div><div class=\"vc_tta-panel-body\"><div class=\"vc_empty_space\" style=\"height: 32px\"><span class=\"vc_empty_space_inner\"></span></div><p>The City operates under a Mayor-Council form of government.

    "textofpage": "Preliminary Financial Report FY20\n\nOne of the City Controller’s primary responsibilities is analyzing and reporting on the City’s financial health. The Preliminary Financial Report, made available each October after the City’s books are closed, is the first of such report each year. It provides information on how the City spent its money over the past fiscal year, with data and analysis of the City’s revenues and expenditures, reserves and bonded indebtedness. As this report is the first to capture the initial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, it shows a glimpse of the economic challenges to come. Scroll below to view the report summary with interactive data visualizations, followed by the full text of the report.\n\nRevenues\n\nDuring the 2019-20 fiscal year, revenue grew by 2.3% in the General Fund and shrank by -2% in on-budget special funds. The COVID-19 pandemic caused revenues to come in 3.7% short of projections. View this interactive data visualization to explore the relative size of the City’s revenue sources and their growth over the past 10 years.\n\nExpenditures\n\nTotal expenditures grew at a rate of 10%, due in large part to salary and benefit increases and capital improvement projects. This interactive data visualization compares the expenditures of the City’s different departments, as well as non-departmental expenditures, over the past 10 years.\n\nReserves\n\nThe Reserve Fund is established to ensure that funds are available for unanticipated expenditures and revenue shortfalls in the General Fund. The City’s Reserve Fund Policy sets a goal for the Reserve Fund of at least 5% of the General Fund budget every year. On July 1, 2020, the Reserve Fund had a balance of $262.5 million, 3.93% of the General Fund budget and below the 5% Reserve Fund Policy goal.\n\nThe Budget Stabilization Fund (BSF) was added to the City Charter in 2011. The purpose of the BSF is to set aside funds when revenue projections are exceeded to help smooth out years when revenue is stagnant or is in decline. In fiscal year 2020, the BSF grew slightly to $107.2 million but stayed about flat as a percentage of General Fund revenues. Click the chart below to view the performance of the Reserve Fund and Budget Stabilization Fund, both in dollar terms and as a percentage of budgeted General Fund revenues.\n\nDebt\n\nThe City’s debt management policy establishes guidelines for the structure and management of the City’s debt obligations. These guidelines include a non-voter-approved debt service cap of 6% and a total debt service cap of 15% as a percent of General Fund revenues. The City’s total indebtedness and debt service obligations increased slightly to 5.6% last fiscal year.\n\nTo address looming financial issues, the following recommendations are set forth in the Preliminary Financial Report:\n\nFocus on revenue and limit spending: While tourism-related revenues dropped, the City must work harder to collect from its other revenue streams and collaborate with stakeholders to prevent further spending increases.\nRebuild the Reserve Fund: To balance the budget, the City transferred nearly $200 million from its reserves to the General Fund, highlighting the need to rebuild this critical resource, which exists for emergencies like this.\nLeverage City properties and special funds: The City owns hundreds of unused or underutilized properties and has billions of dollars in special funds. Policymakers should determine whether either can be used to improve the City’s financial position and help local residents.\nExpand infrastructure programs to rebuild communities: Given the present revenue crunch, the City should explore debt financing opportunities to create jobs through infrastructure projects, including street and sidewalk repair and information technology modernization. These efforts should be concentrated in areas of the City most impacted by COVID-19 and historically disadvantaged communities to achieve greater equity throughout Los Angeles.\nCOVER LETTER\n\nOctober 21, 2020\n\nHonorable Eric Garcetti, Mayor\nHonorable Members of the Los Angeles City Council\n\nRe: Preliminary Financial Report for Fiscal Year 2019-20\n\nThe Controller’s Office submits the Preliminary Financial Report each fall to look back at the City of Los Angeles’ financial operations for the prior fiscal year. Our report is the City’s first review of municipal finances after the close of the fiscal year, providing an overview and analysis of revenues and expenditures, reserves and bonded indebtedness. In early 2021, my office will follow up by issuing the City’s Comprehensive Annual Financial Report for 2019-20, which is prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles and audited by an independent firm of certified public accountants.\n\nAccompanying the Preliminary Financial Report is an online interactive tool for exploring revenues and expenditures, with 10 years of data, which can be found at lacontroller.org/pfr2020. Information on special fund balances and uses, Reserve Fund starting balances over the years, and budget appropriations, adjustments, expenditures and revenues, are also available on our website.\n\nThe report is prepared to help City leaders understand and assess the health of and challenges facing the City’s finances — an especially indispensable task given that we are still in the throes of the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the unique nature of this economic downturn, assessing the initial stages of the impact of the coronavirus on the City’s revenues and expenditures, reserves and outstanding debt — all of which are discussed in the report — are critical to navigating the current fiscal year and those just ahead, while highlighting the absolute need for continued responsible financial management.\n\nGood year gone bad\n\nHighlighted in the Preliminary Financial Report are these facts about the 2019-20 fiscal year:\n\nFiscal year 2019-20 experienced strong revenue growth during the first three quarters, with General Fund revenues growing 7.5 percent ($300.3 million) over the same period in the prior year;\nBut the enormous disruption caused by the coronavirus resulted in final General Fund revenues coming in $196 million (3 percent) under the adopted budget and $143 million (2.3 percent) over the previous fiscal year;\nThe drop in travel and hospitality caused Transient Occupancy Tax revenue to plummet 22.4 percent ($73.1 million) below the budget and 20.5 percent ($65.3 million) less than the year prior;\nTotal expenditures and encumbrances grew at a rate of 10 percent overall as a result of salary increases and capital improvement projects. Responding to the public health crisis further stressed the City’s finances;\nThe pandemic showed how essential reserves are to the City and the need to build them during growth years. Starting fiscal year 2019-20 at 6.2 percent of General Fund receipts, the needs of balancing the budget required the transfer of $195.5 million to the General Fund, causing the Reserve Fund balance to drop below the five percent policy threshold at the beginning of the current fiscal year. Despite this, it still remains a resource that the City must monitor closely to ensure funds remain on hand if additional emergency funding is needed.\n\nUncertainty reigns\n\nWhile the report reviews last fiscal year’s numbers, there are glaring concerns that impact the City’s overall financial outlook. Now, as we near the midpoint of the current fiscal year, the scope of any near-term economic recovery remains highly uncertain, casting doubt on revenue projections and expenses. This is a major risk that must be considered throughout the fiscal year as the City Council revisits the budget, which must be done regularly to maintain fiscal balance and respond to the difficulties ahead. In addition, expenditures will continue to grow due to increased salary and employee benefit costs. Such costs will put constraints on the City’s ability to maintain services, especially if revenues do not begin to recover quickly. To proactively address these issues, my office recommends that the City further remain cautious when considering future staffing and related spending requests.\n\nUse debt financing to boost equity\n\nThe City’s debt service requirements increased slightly to 5.6 percent of General Fund revenues, but remained considerably below the policy limit of 15 percent. Given the present revenue crunch, the City should consider exploring additional debt financing opportunities, which could help create jobs through large-scale infrastructure projects, including street and sidewalk repair and information technology modernization to improve broadband access. These efforts should be concentrated in areas of the City that have been disproportionately impacted by COVID-19 and in historically disadvantaged communities to achieve greater equity throughout Los Angeles.\n\nMy staff and I appreciate the cooperation shown by City departments as we prepared this report. Should you have questions or need more information, please contact my Director of Financial Analysis and Reporting, Matthew Crawford: (213) 978-7203 or matthew.crawford@lacity.org.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nRON GALPERIN\nL.A. Controller\n\ncc:    Sharon Tso, Chief Legislative Analyst\nRichard H. Llewellyn Jr., City Administrative Officer\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nAt the close of each fiscal year, the Office of the Controller reports on the finances of the City for the year that just ended. This Preliminary Financial Report is the first piece of that reporting and provides cash basis information on revenues, expenditures, reserves, and bonded indebtedness, including comparisons to the prior year and to the Budget.\n\nThe second piece of this reporting requirement is the Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (CAFR), the City’s official, audited financial statement, which will be released later this fiscal year. Together, these two documents educate and inform both City decision-makers and the public on the City’s financial situation.\n\nA Good Year Gone Bad\n\nFiscal Year 2019-20, which ended on June 30, 2020, experienced strong revenue growth over the first three quarters of the year, with General Fund revenue growing 7.5 percent ($300.3 million) over the same period in the prior year.\n\nThe Coronavirus pandemic has brought about widespread economic disruption, causing a wave of job losses and ending the longest expansion since World War II. After three solid quarters of revenue growth, revenues reacted to the economic shutdown in the fourth quarter, resulting in final revenues $196 million under the budget, just $143 million (2.3%) over fiscal year 2018-19. Coupled with the need to increase expenditures to respond to the public health crisis, this placed a huge stress on the City’s finances.\n\nIn the short term, this stress will cause disruption to projects and programs, as we have already seen, and set strategic initiatives back as funding is reduced. However, it should be noted that, as detailed later in the report, the City still has a treasury of well over $11 billion, almost $400 million in combined reserves, and a diverse revenue base which mitigates and spreads the impact of economic crises. Looking forward, the strength and speed of the City’s recovery depends on how the pandemic and the economy will unfold, and the projections are subject to an unusually high degree of uncertainty.\n\nAn interactive presentation of the report is available at:\n\nhttps://lacontroller.org/pfr2020\n\nThe Preliminary Financial Report is organized in five distinct sections:\n\nRevenues and Expenditures: A discussion of the fiscal year that just ended, including trend analysis, notable changes from prior years, and financial performance relative to the Budget\nReserve Fund: A discussion of the current condition of the City’s Reserve Fund, and analysis of the various factors influencing that figure\nBudget Stabilization Fund: A discussion of the Fund policy and how actual figures compare to the policy\nBonded Indebtness: A statement of the City’s total bonded indebtedness and debt service requirements; as well as comparisons to City policies and legal limitations.\nRecommendations: Strategic actions the City can take to best weather the recession and jumpstart the recovery.\nUncertainty and Opportunity\n\nRevenues and Expenditures\n\nTotal Revenue grew by 0.9 percent over the prior year. Receipts from Property Tax, Business Tax, Licenses, Permits, Fees, and Fines, Electric Users’ Tax, Interest, and Grants were the only ones above last year’s receipts. While General Fund revenue increased by 4.5 percent for the first half of the year, the pandemic turned everything upside down, and we closed the year just 2.3 percent above last year, 3.0 percent below the budget. Revenue in budgeted special funds decreased by 2.0 percent year over year, 16.7 percent under budget.\n\nTotal expenditures and encumbrances grew at a rate of 10.0 percent. Expenditures rose 8.8 percent, led by salary and capital improvement projects. Encumbrances increased 26.1 percent from June 30, 2019 to June 30, 2020.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2020, the pandemic and associated social distancing ended the longest expansion and triggered the deepest downturn in output and employment since World War II. Key industries, like travel and hospitality have fallen by more than 75 percent. Transient Occupancy Tax Revenue was affected the most, 22.4 percent or $73.1 million below the budget and 20.5 percent or $65.3 million less than last year.\n\nIn this rapidly evolving environment and unusually high degree of uncertainty, it is hard to forecast economic recovery, and this is a major risk to the 2020-21 Budget. Compounding Frequent and ongoing review of the Budget will be necessary throughout the year to monitor and maintain fiscal balance and to respond the challenge ahead.\n\nReserve Fund\n\nThe COVID-19 Pandemic proved once again that the key to preparing for future downturns is to increase the City’s reserves during years of strong growth. In the last ten fiscal years, with a combination of strong revenue growth and fiscal restraint, the Reserve Fund balance rose from 3.9 percent in 2009-10 to its 8.2 percent peak at the beginning of 2015-16, then declining to 6.2 percent in the 2019-20 Adopted General Fund Budget, still well above the 5 percent policy goal.\n\nThis policy was rewarded in 2019-20, as balancing the budget required the transfer of $195.5 million from the Reserve Fund to the General Fund. As a result, the Reserve Fund Balance started 2020-21 at 3.9 percent of the General Fund Budget, below the 5 percent policy level and almost as low as in 2010-11 in absolute terms, but at $262 million, still a significant resource as the City moves into 2020-21.\n\nAs the year progresses, the City will need to carefully monitor, and hopefully bolster, its reserves so that funds are available to mitigate the impact of future events.\n\nBudget Stabilization Fund\n\nThe Budget Stabilization Fund (BSF) is the City’s mechanism for accumulating excess tax revenues in growth years in order to mitigate shortfalls in lean years. The June 30, 2020 balance in the Fund was $116.6 million. While the revenue estimates in the 2020-21 Budget would have allowed for a transfer from the BSF, none was taken, meaning that this money will still be available if needed to meet future needs.\n\nBonded Indebtness\n\nBonded indebtedness and the City’s debt service obligations increased slightly due to the issuance of MICLA-2019 Street Lights Financing bonds. Debt service payments increased as well, from 5.5 percent to 5.6 percent of General Fund revenue, but are still well under the City’s 15 percent policy ceiling.\n\nThis low level of debt, combined with historically low interest rates, presents the possibility of utilizing this capacity to invest in the City’s many infrastructure needs. If the City were to undertake a large capital program, it could meet critical needs for facility and infrastructure repair and replacement, serve as a much-needed economic stimulus and jobs creator, and provide an opportunity to strategically invest in communities across the City that have historically missed out on opportunities, especially during economic disruptions.\n\nRecommendations\n\nBased on the information provided in this report, and based on our knowledge and understanding of recessions and recoveries in years past, we make the following recommendations:\n\nOptimize the City’s revenue streams and rein in spending;\nBegin Rebuilding the City’s Reserve Fund;\nLeverage the City’s numerous assets, including real property, talented people, and numerous special funds, to get the most out of what we have; and,\nStrongly consider a large expansion of the City’s capital program, focusing on critical needs as well as strategic opportunities to invest in historically disadvantaged neighborhoods and people.\nSECTION I: REVENUES AND EXPENDITURES\n\nTotal Revenues in budgeted funds for 2019-20 were $9.17 billion, an increase of 0.9 percent over 2018-19, while total expenditures (excluding encumbrances) increased by 8.8 percent to $8.95 billion, which includes $441 million payments of prior year’s encumbrances. In addition to the expenditures, the City had $779.2 million encumbered as of June 30, 2020.\n\nExhibit 1 below shows the ten-year history of total revenues and expenditures.\n\n\nSince 2010-11, revenues have grown by 41.5 percent (average annual growth of 4.0 percent), while expenditures have grown by 49.1 percent (average annual growth of 4.6 percent). As seen in Exhibit 1, revenues have consistently exceeded expenditures. Most of this excess has been in the City’s many budgeted special funds. The surplus in the General Fund has been a much smaller portion of the total, but still has allowed the City to grow the Reserve and Budget Stabilization Funds.\n\nIt is critical to note that, while revenues continued to exceed expenditures in 2019-20, the surplus shrank significantly due to slow revenue growth and higher than usual expenditure growth. More detail on these results is provided below.\n\nThe 2019-20 Budget totaled $9.93 billion (excluding $784.7 million in available balances), of which $6.57 billion was in the General Fund and $3.36 billion was in Special Funds. Actual receipts for the year (excluding available balances) were $9.17 billion, 7.6 percent less than budgeted, while total expenditures (including encumbrances) were $9.73 billion, 9.2 percent less than budgeted. Detail of budgeted and actual receipts and expenditures is presented in Schedules III and IV.\n\nGeneral Fund Revenues\n\nThe General Fund is the primary operating fund of the City. It is used to account for all financial resources except those legally required to be accounted for in other funds. General Fund revenues are derived from such sources as taxes, licenses, permits, fees, fines, intergovernmental revenues, charges for services, special assessments, and interest income. Exhibit 2 presents 2019-20 actual General Fund revenues by percentage.\n\nActual 2019-20 General Fund receipts totaled $6.37 billion, $195.5 million (3.0 percent) less than the Budget and $143.1 million (2.3 percent) more than 2018-19. Over the past five years, General Fund revenue averaged 4.5 percent growth, exceeding the Budget twice and coming up short three times, though 2019-20 is the only year in this series where the actuals were significantly different from the budget. Exhibit 3 below presents a comparison between adopted and actual General Fund receipts by fiscal year.\n\nThe General Fund revenues that outperformed the Budget in 2019-20 were Gas User’s Tax ($10.5 million or 16.6 percent), Franchise Income ($3.8 million or 4.7 percent), Interest Income ($9.7 million or 26.5 percent), and Grant Receipts ($2.7 million or 17.0 percent).\n\nProperty Tax receipts exceeded expectations due to another year of strong growth in assessed property values, $121.8 million (6.1 percent) higher than 2019 receipts. Ex-CRA property tax increment revenue was $16.3 million less than budget but $10.1 million more than the prior year.\n\nThe Budget assumed 9 percent growth for Business Tax receipts, and actual receipts were 8.7 percent or $52.7 million higher than last year, just 0.2 percent or $1.3 million lower than the Budget. Recreational cannabis retail activity exceeded expectations by $2.1 million (2.8 percent), generating $78.3 million (11.9 percent of total business taxes), even though cash payments for recreational cannabis business taxes were not accepted after March due to COVID-19 facility closures. Meanwhile non-cannabis business tax actual receipts of $577.6 million, were 0.6 percent or $3.4 million lower than the budget, and 3.2 percent or $18.0 million more than last year.  Due to the timing of the business tax, which is due in February for activity in the prior calendar year, the anticipated negative impact of COVID-19 on non-cannabis business tax will be seen in 2020-21 receipts.\n\nSales Tax Receipts were $12.6 million or 2.8 percent higher than last year as of the end of March, but ended $33.6 million or 5.7 percent less than the budget, and $25.2 million or 4.3 percent lower than last year. In addition to lower receipts associated with reduced economic activity, the Tax Deferment Program implemented by the State affected the collected revenues. It is hard to differentiate these two impacts, so we do not know how much of the reduced receipts will be recovered in future periods.\n\nFranchise Income ended higher than budget by $3.8 million, mainly due to natural gas and Multi Family Solid waste fees that exceeded the budget by $1.4 and $2.9 million respectively.\n\nUtility Users’ Tax had a net decrease of 0.9 percent.  While Gas Users Tax exceeded the budget by $10.5 million due to delayed implementation of a legal settlement, Electrical Users and Telephone Users Taxes were $24.3 million under the budget (2.8 and 8.3 percent respectively). While Utility Users Tax has historically been considered economically sensitive, only the Electrical Users’ Tax has shown any correlation to larger economic trends in recent years.\n\nLicenses, Permits, Fees and Fines ended $68.5 million or 6.1 percent higher than last year, but lower than the budget ($28.6 million or 2.3 percent). Somewhat surprisingly, departmental receipts (relating mainly to licenses, permits, and various service fees collected by departments) were strong, exceeding budgeted amounts. The main driver of the shortfall was a $49M shortfall in reimbursements from special funds, due mainly to vacant special-funded positions.\n\nTransient Occupancy Tax (commonly known as Hotel Tax) receipts experienced the most dramatic impact from COVID-19, since travel and hospitality virtually stopped. While receipts were at or very slightly below 2018-19 during the first nine months, they dropped off over the last quarter, with May and June receipts more than 80 percent lower than the prior year. By year end, TOT was $73.1 million or 22.4 percent below budget and $65.3 million or 20.5 percent less than last year.\n\nExhibit 4 shows cumulative Transient Occupancy Tax monthly receipts for FY 2019 and FY 2020.\n\nUnfortunately, TOT will also likely be the last revenue category to recover.  Even as travel has ticked up slightly six month later, the hotel industry remains on the brink of collapse.  The accommodations sector is left with a devastating unemployment rate of 38%, and cripplingly low occupancy rates of 38% in urban markets. How and when this sector recovers will be a defining factor in the City’s overall recovery.\n\nDocumentary Transfer Tax receipts were short $6.5 million or 3.1 percent compared to the budget and $738 thousand or 0.4 percent compared to last year. While the great recession was defined by the collapse of the real estate market, including a 60 percent drop in Documentary Transfer Tax receipts, the current recession has so far left this sector relatively untouched, with a short disruption in the spring due to social distancing requirements and near-complete recovery by July.\n\nThe Power Revenue Transfer was $5.7 million (2.4 percent) less than budget.  It has been declining slowly since 2016, with a 3.6 percent average decrease over the last four years.\n\nExhibit 5 below displays a 10-year history of General Fund receipts, excluding transfers from Reserve Fund.\n\nAppropriations, Expenditures & Encumbrances\n\nTotal expenditures, including encumbrances, were $9.73 billion. This was $883.3 million or 10.0 percent higher than 2018-19, but $982.8 million or 9.2 percent lower than the Budget.\n\nExhibit 6 below presents a comparison between the Budget, the final budget (which includes interim appropriations made during the year), and actual expenditures and encumbrances by fiscal year.\n\nFor the last five years total actual Expenditures and Encumbrances have grown by an average of 5.7 percent.  For the same period, Salaries (excluding Library and Recreations and Parks) increased by 5.1 percent, and Services, Supplies, Equipment and Others by 9.8 percent. Salaries are made up of Sworn and Civilian Salaries, which increased by 4.5 and 7.4 percent respectively.\n\nExhibit 7 below breaks out summarized categories of budgetary and actual expenditures and encumbrances for 2018-19 and 2019-20. Detailed information by department can be found in Schedule IV.\n\nSalaries increased by $345.1 million or 9.6 percent compared to last year due to new labor agreements that didn’t materialize in the last year because of the timing of execution of those agreements. On account of retroactive nature of some of those agreements, the impact anticipated in 2018-19 was part of 2019-20 salary growth.\n\nTotal contributions to Library and Recreation and Parks, which increased by a $13.0 million or 7.3 percent and $20.1 million or 10.0 percent respectively, are made pursuant to Charter requirements and are tied to growth in the City’s total assessed valuation.\n\nCapital Improvement Expenditure Program (CIEP) expenditures were 36.0 percent or $163.3 million lower than budget, but $115.1 million higher than the prior year. The largest increase from was in Refuse Collection and Disposal System Projects funded by new Green Bonds issued in 2018.\n\nHuman Resources Benefits expenses were $12.2 million or 1.6 percent above the budget, and higher by $29.3 million or 4.0 percent compared to last year. The increase was primarily due to increases in Health care subsidies for civilian and sworn employees, by $11.8 million or 2.4 percent, and Worker’s Compensation costs, which increased by $14.8 million or 7.5 percent.\n\nExhibit 8 below breaks out expenditures and encumbrances by Governmental Activity.\n\nAlmost a third of total expenditures were spent on Protection of Persons and Property. Even as priorities have shifted and the economy has expanded, this percentage has remained remarkably stable.\n\nAlso of note were the contributions to the City’s pension systems, which totaled $1.4 billion, 14.1 percent of total spending. This is up slightly from the prior year, and is expected to increase again as the impact of the market volatility is absorbed into the systems’ actuarial models. To the extent that the City is able to hold salary expenditures under long-term averages, the increase will be mitigated, but this issues should be monitored carefully.\n\nThe City ended the fiscal year with a total of $779.2 million in encumbrances:  $541.8 million in the General Fund and $237.4 million in special funds. $246.9 million was encumbered for salaries to be paid in July 2020, with the balance encumbered in expense, equipment, and special fund project accounts.\n\nEncumbered funds for salaries are earmarked for the last pay period of the fiscal year and unspent funds are immediately released after payroll is made. Funds encumbered for expense accounts are continued across fiscal years to ensure that cash is available to cover the expenditure when it is made. Schedule V provides a listing of General Fund encumbrances by department.\n\nThe General Fund Encumbrance Policy provides that encumbered funds that remain unspent for a period longer than one fiscal year shall be disencumbered every fiscal year, with the exception of capital project funds.  Prior-year encumbrances are automatically disencumbered unless exempted by Mayor and Council approval. As part of the 2019-20 Year-End Financial Status Report, a total of $57.1 million was exempted from disencumbrances, an increase of $18.2 million from last year’s exemptions. As noted in past years, this is an issue which deserves more attention.\n\nUnencumbered General funds revert to the Reserve Fund at year end. As such, exemptions to the automatic disencumbrance policy reduce reversions, thereby reducing the cash available in the Reserve Fund to pay for emergencies and contingencies. Section II below discusses the status of the Reserve Fund in more detail.\n\nSECTION II: RESERVE FUND\n\nThe Reserve Fund is established to ensure that funds are available for unanticipated expenditures and revenue shortfalls in the General Fund, and is broken into an Emergency Account and a Contingency Account.\n\nThe Emergency Reserve Account is fixed at 2.75 percent of the adopted General Fund receipts. A finding of urgent economic necessity is required to use these funds. The Contingency Reserve Account includes all monies in the Reserve Fund over and above the amount required to be allocated to the Emergency Account. Contingency Reserve Account funds can be a source of additional funding to cover unanticipated expenses or revenue shortfalls.\n\nThe City’s Reserve Fund Policy (CF 98-0459) sets a Reserve Fund cash balance goal of at least 5.0 percent of budgeted General Fund receipts. Exhibit 9 below displays the past ten years of beginning Emergency and Contingency Reserve Fund balances compared to this policy target.\n\nThe Reserve Fund is an important measure of the City’s fiscal health, and is vital to cash flow, bond ratings, and the ability to manage financial challenges.\n\nFailure to maintain the City’s Reserve Fund at an adequate level not only exposes the City to significant risk in the event of an emergency, but can also have negative financial impacts due to increased cost of borrowing. The City proved the worth of strong reserves in 2019-20, when much of the built-up reserves were used to make up for revenue shortfalls. However, to date there has not been any negative feedback from rating agencies, as they have been focused more on the City’s ample liquidity and strong fiscal management.\n\nReserve Fund Status\n\nAfter the 2019-20 accounting close, budgetary appropriations, return of advances, and reappropriations, the fiscal year-start adjusted Reserve Fund balance was $262.5 million or 3.93 percent of General Fund receipts anticipated in the 2020-21 Budget, $71.8 million below the 5.0 percent Reserve Fund Policy goal.\n\nExhibit 10, below, shows Adopted and Actual Beginning Reserve Fund Balances for last ten years.\n\nThe Reserve Fund balance increased significantly from 2011-12 to 2015-16, hitting 8.18 percent in 2015-16. From 2016-17 to 2019-20, the percentage varied in the 5.5 to 6 percent range, less than prior years but still above the policy minimum. While the 2020-21 amount is significantly less than previous years, it is $19.8 million higher than the $242.7 million assumed in the Budget, primarily due to General Fund revenue finishing the year better than projected in the Budget.\n\nAdjustments to the Reserve Fund Cash Balance\n\nAt the end of each fiscal year and the beginning of the next, a number of transactions are required to accurately reflect the status of the Reserve Fund through the closing of the City’s books. Exhibit 11 details the year-end and year-start adjustments to the Reserve Fund Cash Balance, comparing Budget versus actual.\n\nFollowing are descriptions of the line item changes to the Reserve Fund listed in Exhibit 11:\n\nReserve Fund Cash Balance (June 30, 2020)\n\nAs of June 30, 2020, after closing the City’s General Ledger, the recorded Reserve Fund balance was $262.5 million. This was $19.8 million more than the amount anticipated in the 2020-21 Budget. The Reserve Fund cash balance is adjusted by the following factors to arrive at the year-end balance:\n\na.   Balance Before Year-End Reversions/Borrowings\n\nThe amount of cash available in the Contingency Reserve prior to adjustments for year-end reversions, unallocated revenues, and borrowings. It does not include cash in the Emergency Reserve. For 2019-20, this amount was lower than anticipated in the budget due to higher than anticipated advances and non-reimbursable transfers to other funds made after the adoption of the budget.\n\nb.   General Fund Revenue Shortfall Funding\n\nAs part of the Year-End Financial Status Report (C.F. 19-0600-S180), the Council authorized the Controller to transfer up to $288 million from the Reserve Fund to fully fund appropriations.  The actual shortfall was $195.5 million, which was transferred from the Reserve Fund.\n\nc.   Reversion of Uncommitted Balances\n\nUncommitted General Fund appropriations are reverted to the Reserve Fund at fiscal year-end. Appropriations (spending authority) granted to City departments by the Mayor and Council are committed throughout the year in the form of encumbrances and expenditures. Remaining or uncommitted balances are reverted to the Reserve Fund to the extent that there is available cash in the General Fund.\n\nIn 2019-20, the budget estimated $176.2 million in reversions. The uncommitted balance at year end was $224.9 million. Excluding unfunded appropriations, a total of $163.9 million reverted to the Reserve Fund. For a detailed breakdown of uncommitted balances by department, please see Schedule VII.\n\nd.   Advances Under CF 19-0600-S179\n\nCouncil File 19-0600-S179 authorized the Controller to borrow from the Reserve Fund at year-end to balance departmental budgets where needed in order to facilitate the closing of the City’s General Ledger. The Controller is authorized to increase appropriations within established limits without getting itemized Mayor and Council approval, a process that would delay the closing of the City’s General Ledger. An advance of $500 was made to the General Services department.\n\ne.   Advances Under Charter Section 261(i) for Unfunded Encumbrances and Expenditures\n\nUnder Charter Section 261(i), the Controller transfers funds from the Reserve Fund as a loan to any fund that becomes depleted due to tardy receipt of revenue. The 2020-21 Budget estimated $50.0 million in year-end advances. Actual advances were $31.3 million, consisting of $17.1 million in unfunded expenditures and $14.2 million in unfunded encumbrances. See Schedule VIII for a breakdown by department.\n\nUnfunded expenditures generally occur when expenditures occur prior to receipts (e.g. grants on reimbursement basis) and/or due to billing delays. When the funding source reimburses the costs, departments are able to repay the advances. If funding is not available, departments may request Mayor and Council approval to write-off the advances. Unfunded encumbered amounts represent a technical adjustment at year-end and are reversed at the start of the new fiscal year as documented in item (f), below.\n\nReserve Fund Cash Balance (2020-21 Year-Start)\n\nThe 2019-20 year-end Reserve Fund cash balance is not the same as the 2020-21 year-start cash balance. The following technical adjustments are made after the close of the prior fiscal year.\n\nf.   Return of Advances for Unfunded Encumbrances\n\nAdvances for unfunded encumbrances are reversed at the start of the following fiscal year, as discussed in item (e), above.\n\ng.   General Fund Appropriation to Reserve Fund\n\nThe 2020-21 Budget included an appropriation to the Reserve Fund totaling $12,343,213.\n\nh.   Reappropriations\n\nThe 2020-21 Budget and other Council actions (C.F. 19-0600-S180, 19-0600-S183, 19-0926-S4, 19-0078, and 18-0628) provided that certain uncommitted balances earmarked for specific programs would be reappropriated in the subsequent year if not expended by the year-end. See Schedule VII for reappropriations by department. Actual reappropriations of $169.3 million were $6.6 million above the estimated $162.7 million budget.\n\ni.   Adjustment\n\nHistorically, the Budget reflects the City Council’s changes to the Mayor’s Proposed Budget.  As the City council did not approve or modify the Mayor’s Proposed Budget before June 1, 2020, it became the 2020-21 City budget pursuant to Charter Section 313.  The City Council and the Mayor, however, approved various adjustments to the Budget on July 1, 2020.  The Controller was instructed to transfer $20 million from fund 63M (COVID-19 Federal Relief Fund) as a reimbursement of the funds transferred to the COVID-19 Emergency Response Account in the General City Purposes Budget (CF 20-0147 Motion No. 72). Also approved in that action was an early reversion of $7 million from the Unappropriated Balance account for General Municipal Elections 2020 to the Reserve Fund.\n\nSECTION III: BUDGET STABILIZATION FUND\n\nThe Budget Stabilization Fund (BSF) was added to the City’s Charter in 2011. The purpose of this fund is to set aside revenues during periods of robust economic growth or when revenue projections are exceeded to help smooth out years when revenue is stagnant or is in decline. The BSF does not have a minimum balance that it must maintain.\n\nThe June 30 Fund balance was $116.6 million. Exhibit 12 below displays the adopted and prior year cash balance and adjustments of the BSF. The Budget of 2019-20 included a deposit of $7.0 million into the Fund, but there is none for 2020-21.\n\nThe current BSF Policy (approved January 21, 2020) states that a budget appropriation shall be included as part of the Budget for the following fiscal year when the anticipated growth in combined receipts from seven City “economically sensitive” revenue categories (Property Tax, Utility Users Tax, Business Tax, Sales Tax, Documentary Transfer Tax, Transient Occupancy Tax, and Parking Users Tax) exceeds the growth threshold.  For each five-tenths of one percent that the anticipated growth exceeds the growth threshold, the amount of the required appropriation to the BSF shall be equal to five percent of the value of the anticipated excess growth. The maximum appropriation shall be equivalent to 25 percent of the value of the growth above the growth threshold. For Fiscal Year 2020-21, the growth rate used to determine BSF contributions was recalculated to be 4.3 percent, based on the 20-year historical average of these tax revenues.\n\nThe required deposit to the BSF may be forgone completely in the case that the City Council and Mayor declare a fiscal emergency or suspend the BSF funding policy based on findings that it is in the best interest of the City to suspend the policy. Mid-year deposits to the BSF or deposits above the required amount may be authorized by the City Council, subject to the approval of the Mayor, at any time during the year from various General Fund sources. Consideration should be given to depositing unanticipated and unbudgeted receipts that are not otherwise required to balance the current year budget.\n\nSECTION IV: BONDED INDEBTEDNESS\n\nThe City’s Debt Management Policy establishes guidelines for the structure and management of the City’s debt obligations. These guidelines include target and ceiling levels for certain debt ratios to be used for planning purposes. The two most significant ratios are a non-voter-approved debt service cap as a percent of General Fund revenues of 6 percent and a total debt service cap as a percent of General Fund revenues of 15 percent.\n\nCouncil File 20-0161, dated September 23, 2020, approved revisions to the Debt Management Policy. There is no impact to the City’s debt levels or capacity resulting from the adoption of the revised Debt management Policy, as the changes were mainly to conform with changes in the municipal debt market.\n\nExhibit 13, below, illustrates the City’s compliance with these debt management policies for the past five years.\n\nThe actual ratio of Debt Service to General Fund Receipts was 5.6 percent in 2019-20. The ratio increased because the first Principal payment for Series 2018-A General Obligation Bonds, issued in 2018-19, was due in current year. This issuance provided funds in the amount of $276.2 million for Proposition HHH Housing and Homeless Facilities projects. Schedule IX shows the details of Outstanding General Obligation Bonded Debt.\n\nExhibit 13 above shows very clearly the responsibility the City has exhibited when it comes to debt management. Good administration of debt service obligations has put the City in a position to consider major projects, as well as making strategic financing agreements available when these present financial advantages.\n\nThis significant amount of debt capacity also indicates an opportunity to invest in large-scale long-term infrastructure projects, including both facility repair and replacement as well as new projects designed to stimulate economic development. Such an investment would also provide an opportunity to focus on regional equity, focusing investment in areas of the City which have often been left behind in prior initiatives. More generally, a significantly expanded capital program would serve as a fiscal stimulus for the entire region, adding jobs to a struggling economy and providing the infrastructure for future opportunity.\n\nSECTION V: RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nThe current crisis demands decisive action on the part of the City’s leaders, who must simultaneously consider how to balance the City’s books in the short term and how to position the City to benefit in the long term. To this end, we make the following recommendations:\n\nOptimize the City’s revenue and rein in spending. With the current recession having brought the travel and hospitality industries down by 70 to 80 percent, and funding streams related to parking and retail sales showing signs of significant slowdown, the City must work to get the most out of the revenue streams that are still coming in. At the same time, we must work together to find the least disruptive possible ways of reducing, or at least curtailing increases in, our spending.\nBegin rebuilding the City’s Reserve Fund. Fiscal Year 2019-20 was a textbook example of why strong reserves are a critical piece of economic resilience. If the City had not spent the last decade building the Reserve Fund up above the 5 percent policy threshold, much more dramatic cuts would have been necessary right away, and our current position would be much more precarious. The time is now to start planning on how to begin growing these reserves again.\nLeverage the City’s numerous assets. The City has vast resources of real property, talented people, and numerous special funds. All of these represent opportunities to develop and grow out of this recession. The alternative is to leave things as they are, ensuring that our recovery, and our City, will be less than it could be.\nStrongly consider a large expansion of the City’s capital program, focusing on critical needs as well as strategic opportunities to invest in historically disadvantaged neighborhoods and people. As discussed in the section on Bonded Indebtedness, the City has legal capacity to borrow more than $8 billion for capital projects. While it would be unwise to ever use all, or even most, of this capacity, a significant investment in our infrastructure and our communities would reap benefits for generations to come.\nSCHEDULES I - V\nSCHEDULE I: CASH CONDITION STATEMENT OF RECIEPTS AND DISBURSMENTS\n\n \n\nSCHEDULE II: RESERVE FUND STATEMENT OF RECEIPTS AND DISBURSMENTS\n\n \n\nSCHEDULE III: STATEMENT OF RECEIPTS – BUDGET AND ACTUAL (CASH BASIS) – ALL ANNUALLY BUDGETED FUNDS\n\n \n\n \n\nSCHEDULE IV: STATEMENT OF BUDGET APPROPRIATIONS, EXPENDITURES AND ENCUMBRANCES BUDGET AND ACTUAL (CASH-BASIS) – ALL ANNUALLY BUDGETED FUNDS\n\n \n\nSCHEDULE V: YEAR-END ENCUMBRANCES – GENERAL FUND\n\n \n\nSCHEDULES VI - X\nSCHEDULE VI: GENERAL FUND UNENCUMBERED BALANCES REVERTED TO THE RESERVE FUND\n\n \n\nSCHEDULE VII: GENERAL FUND YEAR-END UNCOMMITTED BALANCES AND ADOPTED BUDGET REAPPROPRIATIONS\n\n \n\n \n\nSCHEDULE VIII: YEAR-END ADVANCES FROM THE RESERVE FUND FOR UNFUNDED EXPENDITURES AND ENCUMBRANCES\n\n \n\n \n\nSCHEDULE IX: STATEMENT OF GENERAL OBLIGATION BONDED DEBT\n\n \n\n \n\nSCHEDULE X: RATIO OF DEBT SERVICE REQUIREMENT TO GENERAL FUND RECEIPTS LAST TEN FISCAL YEARS\n\n ",

The City’s Reserve Fund Policy sets a goal for the Reserve Fund of at least 5% of the General Fund budget every year. On July 1, 2020, the Reserve Fund had a balance of $262.5 million, 3.93% of the General Fund budget and below the 5% Reserve Fund Policy goal.</p>\n<p>The Budget Stabilization Fund (BSF) was added to the City Charter in 2011. The purpose of the BSF is to set aside funds when revenue projections are exceeded to help smooth out years when revenue is stagnant or is in decline. In fiscal year 2020, the BSF grew slightly to $107.2 million but stayed about flat as a percentage of General Fund revenues.

Our report is the City’s first review of municipal finances after the close of the fiscal year, providing an overview and analysis of revenues and expenditures, reserves and bonded indebtedness. In early 2021, my office will follow up by issuing the City’s Comprehensive Annual Financial Report for 2019-20, which is prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles and audited by an independent firm of certified public accountants.</p>\n<p>Accompanying the Preliminary Financial Report is an online interactive tool for exploring revenues and expenditures, with 10 years of data, which can be found at <a href=\"https://lacontroller.org/financial-reports/preliminary-financial-report-2019/\">lacontroller.org/pfr2020</a>. Information on special fund balances and uses, Reserve Fund starting balances over the years, and budget appropriations, adjustments, expenditures and revenues, are also available on our website.</p>\n<p>The report is prepared to help City leaders understand and assess the health of and challenges facing the City’s finances — an especially indispensable task given that we are still in the throes of the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the unique nature of this economic downturn, assessing the initial stages of the impact of the coronavirus on the City’s revenues and expenditures, reserves and outstanding debt — all of which are discussed in the report — are critical to navigating the current fiscal year and those just ahead, while highlighting the absolute need for continued responsible financial management.</p>\n<p><b>Good year gone bad</b></p>\n<p>Highlighted in the Preliminary Financial Report are these facts about the 2019-20 fiscal year:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fiscal year 2019-20 experienced strong revenue growth during the first three quarters, with General Fund revenues growing 7.5 percent ($300.3 million) over the same period in the prior year;</li>\n<li>But the enormous disruption caused by the coronavirus resulted in final General Fund revenues coming in $196 million (3 percent) under the adopted budget and $143 million (2.3 percent) over the previous fiscal year;</li>\n<li>The drop in travel and hospitality caused Transient Occupancy Tax revenue to plummet 22.4 percent ($73.1 million) below the budget and 20.5 percent ($65.3 million) less than the year prior;</li>\n<li>Total expenditures and encumbrances grew at a rate of 10 percent overall as a result of salary increases and capital improvement projects. Responding to the public health crisis further stressed the City’s finances;</li>\n<li>The pandemic showed how essential reserves are to the City and the need to build them during growth years. Starting fiscal year 2019-20 at 6.2 percent of General Fund receipts, the needs of balancing the budget required the transfer of $195.5 million to the General Fund, causing the Reserve Fund balance to drop below the five percent policy threshold at the beginning of the current fiscal year. Despite this, it still remains a resource that the City must monitor closely to ensure funds remain on hand if additional emergency funding is needed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Uncertainty reigns</b></p>\n<p>While the report reviews last fiscal year’s numbers, there are glaring concerns that impact the City’s overall financial outlook. Now, as we near the midpoint of the current fiscal year, the scope of any near-term economic recovery remains highly uncertain, casting doubt on revenue projections and expenses. This is a major risk that must be considered throughout the fiscal year as the City Council revisits the budget, which must be done regularly to maintain fiscal balance and respond to the difficulties ahead. In addition, expenditures will continue to grow due to increased salary and employee benefit costs. Such costs will put constraints on the City’s ability to maintain services, especially if revenues do not begin to recover quickly. To proactively address these issues, my office recommends that the City further remain cautious when considering future staffing and related spending requests.</p>\n<p><b>Use debt financing to boost equity</b></p>\n<p>The City’s debt service requirements increased slightly to 5.6 percent of General Fund revenues, but remained considerably below the policy limit of 15 percent. Given the present revenue crunch, the City should consider exploring additional debt financing opportunities, which could help create jobs through large-scale infrastructure projects, including street and sidewalk repair and information technology modernization to improve broadband access. These efforts should be concentrated in areas of the City that have been disproportionately impacted by COVID-19 and in historically disadvantaged communities to achieve greater equity throughout Los Angeles.</p>\n<p>My staff and I appreciate the cooperation shown by City departments as we prepared this report.

After three solid quarters of revenue growth, revenues reacted to the economic shutdown in the fourth quarter, resulting in final revenues $196 million under the budget, just $143 million (2.3%) over fiscal year 2018-19. Coupled with the need to increase expenditures to respond to the public health crisis, this placed a huge stress on the City’s finances.</p>\n<p>In the short term, this stress will cause disruption to projects and programs, as we have already seen, and set strategic initiatives back as funding is reduced. However, it should be noted that, as detailed later in the report, the City still has a treasury of well over $11 billion, almost $400 million in combined reserves, and a diverse revenue base which mitigates and spreads the impact of economic crises. Looking forward, the strength and speed of the City’s recovery depends on how the pandemic and the economy will unfold, and the projections are subject to an unusually high degree of uncertainty.</p>\n<p>An interactive presentation of the report is available at:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://lacontroller.org/pfr2020\">https://lacontroller.org/pfr2020</a></p>\n<p>The Preliminary Financial Report is organized in five distinct sections:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Revenues and</strong><strong> Expenditures</strong></span>: A discussion of the fiscal year that just ended, including trend analysis, notable changes from prior years, and financial performance relative to the Budget</li>\n<li><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Reserve Fund</strong></span>: A discussion of the current condition of the City’s Reserve Fund, and analysis of the various factors influencing that figure</li>\n<li><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Budget Stabilization Fund</span></strong>: A discussion of the Fund policy and how actual figures compare to the policy</li>\n<li><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Bonded Indebtness</span></strong>: A statement of the City’s total bonded indebtedness and debt service requirements; as well as comparisons to City policies and legal limitations.</li>\n<li><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Recommendations</strong></span>: Strategic actions the City can take to best weather the recession and jumpstart the recovery.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Uncertainty and Opportunity</h4>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Revenues and Expenditures</strong></span></p>\n<p>Total Revenue grew by 0.9 percent over the prior year. Receipts from Property Tax, Business Tax, Licenses, Permits, Fees, and Fines, Electric Users’ Tax, Interest, and Grants were the only ones above last year’s receipts. While General Fund revenue increased by 4.5 percent for the first half of the year, the pandemic turned everything upside down, and we closed the year just 2.3 percent above last year, 3.0 percent below the budget. Revenue in budgeted special funds decreased by 2.0 percent year over year, 16.7 percent under budget.</p>\n<p>Total expenditures and encumbrances grew at a rate of 10.0 percent. Expenditures rose 8.8 percent, led by salary and capital improvement projects. Encumbrances increased 26.1 percent from June 30, 2019 to June 30, 2020.</p>\n<p>In the first quarter of 2020, the pandemic and associated social distancing ended the longest expansion and triggered the deepest downturn in output and employment since World War II. Key industries, like travel and hospitality have fallen by more than 75 percent. Transient Occupancy Tax Revenue was affected the most, 22.4 percent or $73.1 million below the budget and 20.5 percent or $65.3 million less than last year.</p>\n<p>In this rapidly evolving environment and unusually high degree of uncertainty, it is hard to forecast economic recovery, and this is a major risk to the 2020-21 Budget. Compounding Frequent and ongoing review of the Budget will be necessary throughout the year to monitor and maintain fiscal balance and to respond the challenge ahead.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Reserve Fund</strong></span></p>\n<p>The COVID-19 Pandemic proved once again that the key to preparing for future downturns is to increase the City’s reserves during years of strong growth. In the last ten fiscal years, with a combination of strong revenue growth and fiscal restraint, the Reserve Fund balance rose from 3.9 percent in 2009-10 to its 8.2 percent peak at the beginning of 2015-16, then declining to 6.2 percent in the 2019-20 Adopted General Fund Budget, still well above the 5 percent policy goal.</p>\n<p>This policy was rewarded in 2019-20, as balancing the budget required the transfer of $195.5 million from the Reserve Fund to the General Fund. As a result, the Reserve Fund Balance started 2020-21 at 3.9 percent of the General Fund Budget, below the 5 percent policy level and almost as low as in 2010-11 in absolute terms, but at $262 million, still a significant resource as the City moves into 2020-21.</p>\n<p>As the year progresses, the City will need to carefully monitor, and hopefully bolster, its reserves so that funds are available to mitigate the impact of future events.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Budget Stabilization Fund</strong></span></p>\n<p>The Budget Stabilization Fund (BSF) is the City’s mechanism for accumulating excess tax revenues in growth years in order to mitigate shortfalls in lean years. The June 30, 2020 balance in the Fund was $116.6 million. While the revenue estimates in the 2020-21 Budget would have allowed for a transfer from the BSF, none was taken, meaning that this money will still be available if needed to meet future needs.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Bonded Indebtness</strong></span></p>\n<p>Bonded indebtedness and the City’s debt service obligations increased slightly due to the issuance of MICLA-2019 Street Lights Financing bonds. Debt service payments increased as well, from 5.5 percent to 5.6 percent of General Fund revenue, but are still well under the City’s 15 percent policy ceiling.</p>\n<p>This low level of debt, combined with historically low interest rates, presents the possibility of utilizing this capacity to invest in the City’s many infrastructure needs. If the City were to undertake a large capital program, it could meet critical needs for facility and infrastructure repair and replacement, serve as a much-needed economic stimulus and jobs creator, and provide an opportunity to strategically invest in communities across the City that have historically missed out on opportunities, especially during economic disruptions.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Recommendations</strong></span></p>\n<p>Based on the information provided in this report, and based on our knowledge and understanding of recessions and recoveries in years past, we make the following recommendations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Optimize the City’s revenue streams and rein in spending;</li>\n<li>Begin Rebuilding the City’s Reserve Fund;</li>\n<li>Leverage the City’s numerous assets, including real property, talented people, and numerous special funds, to get the most out of what we have; and,</li>\n<li>Strongly consider a large expansion of the City’s capital program, focusing on critical needs as well as strategic opportunities to invest in historically disadvantaged neighborhoods and people.</li>\n</ul>\n</div></div></div><div class=\"panel panel-default\"><div class=\"panel-heading active-accordion\"><a data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-parent=\"#1602779190\" href=\"#accordian-panel-3\"><h4 class=\"panel-title\">Section I: Revenues and Expenditures<span class=\"pull-right\"><i class=\"fas fa-minus\"></i></span></h4></a></div><div id=\"accordian-panel-3\" class=\"panel-collapse collapsing\" style=\"height: 12010px;\"><div class=\"panel-body\"><p>Total Revenues in budgeted funds for 2019-20 were $9.17 billion, an increase of 0.9 percent over 2018-19, while total expenditures (excluding encumbrances) increased by 8.8 percent to $8.95 billion, which includes $441 million payments of prior year’s encumbrances.

As seen in Exhibit 1, revenues have consistently exceeded expenditures. Most of this excess has been in the City’s many budgeted special funds. The surplus in the General Fund has been a much smaller portion of the total, but still has allowed the City to grow the Reserve and Budget Stabilization Funds.</p>\n<p>It is critical to note that, while revenues continued to exceed expenditures in 2019-20, the surplus shrank significantly due to slow revenue growth and higher than usual expenditure growth. More detail on these results is provided below.</p>\n<p>The 2019-20 Budget totaled $9.93 billion (excluding $784.7 million in available balances), of which $6.57 billion was in the General Fund and $3.36 billion was in Special Funds. Actual receipts for the year (excluding available balances) were $9.17 billion, 7.6 percent less than budgeted, while total expenditures (including encumbrances) were $9.73 billion, 9.2 percent less than budgeted. Detail of budgeted and actual receipts and expenditures is presented in Schedules III and IV.</p>\n<p><strong><u>General Fund Revenues</u></strong></p>\n<p>The General Fund is the primary operating fund of the City. It is used to account for all financial resources except those legally required to be accounted for in other funds. General Fund revenues are derived from such sources as taxes, licenses, permits, fees, fines, intergovernmental revenues, charges for services, special assessments, and interest income. Exhibit 2 presents 2019-20 actual General Fund revenues by percentage.</p>\n<div id=\"viz1602887574426\" class=\"tableauPlaceholder\" style=\"position: relative; width: 100%; height: 727px; overflow: hidden; display: block;\"><noscript><a href='#'><img alt=' ' src='https://public.tableau.com/static/images/PF/PFR_2020_Exhibit2/Dashboard1/1_rss.png' style='border: none' /></a></noscript><script src=\"https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js\"></script><object class=\"tableauViz\" style=\"display: none; width: 100%; height: 727px;\" width=\"300\" height=\"150\"><param name=\"host_url\" value=\"https%3A%2F%2Fpublic.tableau.com%2F\"><param name=\"embed_code_version\" value=\"3\"><param name=\"site_root\" value=\"\"><param name=\"name\" value=\"PFR_2020_Exhibit2/Dashboard1\"><param name=\"tabs\" value=\"no\"><param name=\"toolbar\" value=\"yes\"><param name=\"static_image\" value=\"https://public.tableau.com/static/images/PF/PFR_2020_Exhibit2/Dashboard1/1.png\"><param name=\"animate_transition\" value=\"yes\"><param name=\"display_static_image\" value=\"yes\"><param name=\"display_spinner\" value=\"yes\"><param name=\"display_overlay\" value=\"yes\"><param name=\"display_count\" value=\"yes\"><param name=\"language\" value=\"en\"></object><div style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;right:0;bottom:0;border:0;padding:0;margin:0\"><div style=\"top:100px;left:0;right:0;position:absolute;z-index:991;box-shadow:none;display:flex;justify-content:center;\"><style>#tableau-svg-spinner-container-6{width:65px;height:65px;border-radius:10px;display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center}#tableau-svg-spinner-6{width:50px;height:50px;-webkit-animation:tableau-svg-spinner-animation 1s linear infinite;animation:tableau-svg-spinner-animation 1s linear infinite}@-webkit-keyframes tableau-svg-spinner-animation{100%{-webkit-transform:rotate(360deg)}}@keyframes tableau-svg-spinner-animation{100%{transform:rotate(360deg)}}</style><div id=\"tableau-svg-spinner-container-6\"><svg id=\"tableau-svg-spinner-6\" viewBox=\"0 0 50 50\"><style>#tail{fill:url(#tableau-fade-6)}#head{fill:#616570}stop{stop-color:#616570}</style><linearGradient id=\"tableau-fade-6\" x2=\"50\" y1=\"25\" y2=\"25\" gradientUnits=\"userSpaceOnUse\"><stop offset=\"0\" stop-opacity=\"0\"></stop><stop offset=\".15\" stop-opacity=\".04\"></stop><stop offset=\".3\" stop-opacity=\".16\"></stop><stop offset=\".45\" stop-opacity=\".36\"></stop><stop offset=\".61\" stop-opacity=\".64\"></stop><stop offset=\".76\"></stop></linearGradient><path id=\"head\" d=\"M0 25a25 25 0 1 0 50 0h-3.9a21.1 21.1 0 1 1-42.2 0\"></path><path id=\"tail\" d=\"M50 25a25 25 0 0 0-50 0h3.9a21.1 21.1 0 1 1 42.2 0\"></path></svg></div></div><div style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;right:0;bottom:0;z-index:990;background-color:#EBEBEB;opacity:.24\"></div><style>#tableau-svg-spinner-container-6{border-radius:12px;background:rgba(255,255,255,.6);</style><div style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; right: 0; bottom: 0; background: transparent url('https://public.tableau.com/static/images/PF/PFR_2020_Exhibit2/Dashboard1/1.png?height=0&amp;width=0&amp;deviceScaleFactor=1') no-repeat scroll 0 0; background-size: 0px 0px; box-shadow: none; left:0px; top:1px\"></div></div><iframe frameborder=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" title=\"데이터 비주얼리제이션\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" class=\"tableauViz\" style=\"display: block; width: 100%; height: 727px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: none;\" width=\"300\" height=\"150\"></iframe></div>\n<p><script type=\"text/javascript\">                    var divElement = document.getElementById('viz1602887574426');                    var vizElement = divElement.getElementsByTagName('object')[0];                    if ( divElement.offsetWidth > 800 ) { vizElement.style.width='800px';vizElement.style.height='557px';} else if ( divElement.offsetWidth > 500 ) { vizElement.style.width='100%';vizElement.style.height=(divElement.offsetWidth*0.75)+'px';} else { vizElement.style.width='100%';vizElement.style.height='727px';}                     var scriptElement = document.createElement('script');                    scriptElement.src = 'https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js';                    vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement);                </script></p>\n<p>Actual 2019-20 General Fund receipts totaled $6.37 billion, $195.5 million (3.0 percent) less than the Budget and $143.1 million (2.3 percent) more than 2018-19.

Ex-CRA property tax increment revenue was $16.3 million less than budget but $10.1 million more than the prior year.</p>\n<p>The Budget assumed 9 percent growth for Business Tax receipts, and actual receipts were 8.7 percent or $52.7 million higher than last year, just 0.2 percent or $1.3 million lower than the Budget. Recreational cannabis retail activity exceeded expectations by $2.1 million (2.8 percent), generating $78.3 million (11.9 percent of total business taxes), even though cash payments for recreational cannabis business taxes were not accepted after March due to COVID-19 facility closures. Meanwhile non-cannabis business tax actual receipts of $577.6 million, were 0.6 percent or $3.4 million lower than the budget, and 3.2 percent or $18.0 million more than last year.&nbsp; Due to the timing of the business tax, which is due in February for activity in the prior calendar year, the anticipated negative impact of COVID-19 on non-cannabis business tax will be seen in 2020-21 receipts.</p>\n<p>Sales Tax Receipts were $12.6 million or 2.8 percent higher than last year as of the end of March, but ended $33.6 million or 5.7 percent less than the budget, and $25.2 million or 4.3 percent lower than last year. In addition to lower receipts associated with reduced economic activity, the Tax Deferment Program implemented by the State affected the collected revenues. It is hard to differentiate these two impacts, so we do not know how much of the reduced receipts will be recovered in future periods.</p>\n<p>Franchise Income ended higher than budget by $3.8 million, mainly due to natural gas and Multi Family Solid waste fees that exceeded the budget by $1.4 and $2.9 million respectively.</p>\n<p>Utility Users’ Tax had a net decrease of 0.9 percent.&nbsp; While Gas Users Tax exceeded the budget by $10.5 million due to delayed implementation of a legal settlement, Electrical Users and Telephone Users Taxes were $24.3 million under the budget (2.8 and 8.3 percent respectively). While Utility Users Tax has historically been considered economically sensitive, only the Electrical Users’ Tax has shown any correlation to larger economic trends in recent years.</p>\n<p>Licenses, Permits, Fees and Fines ended $68.5 million or 6.1 percent higher than last year, but lower than the budget ($28.6 million or 2.3 percent). Somewhat surprisingly, departmental receipts (relating mainly to licenses, permits, and various service fees collected by departments) were strong, exceeding budgeted amounts. The main driver of the shortfall was a $49M shortfall in reimbursements from special funds, due mainly to vacant special-funded positions.</p>\n<p>Transient Occupancy Tax (commonly known as Hotel Tax) receipts experienced the most dramatic impact from COVID-19, since travel and hospitality virtually stopped. While receipts were at or very slightly below 2018-19 during the first nine months, they dropped off over the last quarter, with May and June receipts more than 80 percent lower than the prior year. By year end, TOT was $73.1 million or 22.4 percent below budget and $65.3 million or 20.5 percent less than last year.</p>\n<p>Exhibit 4 shows cumulative Transient Occupancy Tax monthly receipts for FY 2019 and FY 2020.</p>\n<div id=\"viz1603147498436\" class=\"tableauPlaceholder\" style=\"position: relative; width: 100%; height: 727px; overflow: hidden; display: block;\"><noscript><a href='#'><img alt=' ' src='https://public.tableau.com/static/images/PF/PFR_2020Exhibits148/PFRExhibit4/1_rss.png' style='border: none' /></a></noscript><script src=\"https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js\"></script><object class=\"tableauViz\" style=\"display: none; width: 100%; height: 727px;\" width=\"300\" height=\"150\"><param name=\"host_url\" value=\"https%3A%2F%2Fpublic.tableau.com%2F\"><param name=\"embed_code_version\" value=\"3\"><param name=\"site_root\" value=\"\"><param name=\"name\" value=\"PFR_2020Exhibits148/PFRExhibit4\"><param name=\"tabs\" value=\"no\"><param name=\"toolbar\" value=\"yes\"><param name=\"static_image\" value=\"https://public.tableau.com/static/images/PF/PFR_2020Exhibits148/PFRExhibit4/1.png\"><param name=\"animate_transition\" value=\"yes\"><param name=\"display_static_image\" value=\"yes\"><param name=\"display_spinner\" value=\"yes\"><param name=\"display_overlay\" value=\"yes\"><param name=\"display_count\" value=\"yes\"><param name=\"language\" value=\"en\"></object><div style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;right:0;bottom:0;border:0;padding:0;margin:0\"><div style=\"top:100px;left:0;right:0;position:absolute;z-index:991;box-shadow:none;display:flex;justify-content:center;\"><style>#tableau-svg-spinner-container-8{width:65px;height:65px;border-radius:10px;display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center}#tableau-svg-spinner-8{width:50px;height:50px;-webkit-animation:tableau-svg-spinner-animation 1s linear infinite;animation:tableau-svg-spinner-animation 1s linear infinite}@-webkit-keyframes tableau-svg-spinner-animation{100%{-webkit-transform:rotate(360deg)}}@keyframes tableau-svg-spinner-animation{100%{transform:rotate(360deg)}}</style><div id=\"tableau-svg-spinner-container-8\"><svg id=\"tableau-svg-spinner-8\" viewBox=\"0 0 50 50\"><style>#tail{fill:url(#tableau-fade-8)}#head{fill:#616570}stop{stop-color:#616570}</style><linearGradient id=\"tableau-fade-8\" x2=\"50\" y1=\"25\" y2=\"25\" gradientUnits=\"userSpaceOnUse\"><stop offset=\"0\" stop-opacity=\"0\"></stop><stop offset=\".15\" stop-opacity=\".04\"></stop><stop offset=\".3\" stop-opacity=\".16\"></stop><stop offset=\".45\" stop-opacity=\".36\"></stop><stop offset=\".61\" stop-opacity=\".64\"></stop><stop offset=\".76\"></stop></linearGradient><path id=\"head\" d=\"M0 25a25 25 0 1 0 50 0h-3.9a21.1 21.1 0 1 1-42.2 0\"></path><path id=\"tail\" d=\"M50 25a25 25 0 0 0-50 0h3.9a21.1 21.1 0 1 1 42.2 0\"></path></svg></div></div><div style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;right:0;bottom:0;z-index:990;background-color:#EBEBEB;opacity:.24\"></div><style>#tableau-svg-spinner-container-8{border-radius:12px;background:rgba(255,255,255,.6);</style><div style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; right: 0; bottom: 0; background: transparent url('https://public.tableau.com/static/images/PF/PFR_2020Exhibits148/PFRExhibit4/1.png?height=0&amp;width=0&amp;deviceScaleFactor=1') no-repeat scroll 0 0; background-size: 0px 0px; box-shadow: none; left:0px; top:1px\"></div></div><iframe frameborder=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" title=\"데이터 비주얼리제이션\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" class=\"tableauViz\" style=\"display: block; width: 100%; height: 727px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: none;\" width=\"300\" height=\"150\"></iframe></div>\n<p><script type=\"text/javascript\">                    var divElement = document.getElementById('viz1603147498436');                    var vizElement = divElement.getElementsByTagName('object')[0];                    if ( divElement.offsetWidth > 800 ) { vizElement.style.width='100%';vizElement.style.height=(divElement.offsetWidth*0.75)+'px';} else if ( divElement.offsetWidth > 500 ) { vizElement.style.width='100%';vizElement.style.height=(divElement.offsetWidth*0.75)+'px';} else { vizElement.style.width='100%';vizElement.style.height='727px';}                     var scriptElement = document.createElement('script');                    scriptElement.src = 'https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js';                    vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement);                </script></p>\n<p>Unfortunately, TOT will also likely be the last revenue category to recover.&nbsp; Even as travel has ticked up slightly six month later, the hotel industry remains on the brink of collapse.&nbsp; The accommodations sector is left with a devastating unemployment rate of 38%, and cripplingly low occupancy rates of 38% in urban markets.

The increase was primarily due to increases in Health care subsidies for civilian and sworn employees, by $11.8 million or 2.4 percent, and Worker’s Compensation costs, which increased by $14.8 million or 7.5 percent.</p>\n<p>Exhibit 8 below breaks out expenditures and encumbrances by Governmental Activity.</p>\n<div id=\"viz1602879930503\" class=\"tableauPlaceholder\" style=\"position: relative; width: 100%; height: 927px; overflow: hidden; display: block;\"><noscript><a href='#'><img alt=' ' src='https://public.tableau.com/static/images/PF/PFR_2020Exhibits148/PFRExhibit8/1_rss.png' style='border: none' /></a></noscript><script src=\"https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js\"></script><object class=\"tableauViz\" style=\"display: none; width: 100%; height: 927px;\" width=\"300\" height=\"150\"><param name=\"host_url\" value=\"https%3A%2F%2Fpublic.tableau.com%2F\"><param name=\"embed_code_version\" value=\"3\"><param name=\"site_root\" value=\"\"><param name=\"name\" value=\"PFR_2020Exhibits148/PFRExhibit8\"><param name=\"tabs\" value=\"no\"><param name=\"toolbar\" value=\"yes\"><param name=\"static_image\" value=\"https://public.tableau.com/static/images/PF/PFR_2020Exhibits148/PFRExhibit8/1.png\"><param name=\"animate_transition\" value=\"yes\"><param name=\"display_static_image\" value=\"yes\"><param name=\"display_spinner\" value=\"yes\"><param name=\"display_overlay\" value=\"yes\"><param name=\"display_count\" value=\"yes\"><param name=\"language\" value=\"en\"></object><div style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;right:0;bottom:0;border:0;padding:0;margin:0\"><div style=\"top:100px;left:0;right:0;position:absolute;z-index:991;box-shadow:none;display:flex;justify-content:center;\"><style>#tableau-svg-spinner-container-11{width:65px;height:65px;border-radius:10px;display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center}#tableau-svg-spinner-11{width:50px;height:50px;-webkit-animation:tableau-svg-spinner-animation 1s linear infinite;animation:tableau-svg-spinner-animation 1s linear infinite}@-webkit-keyframes tableau-svg-spinner-animation{100%{-webkit-transform:rotate(360deg)}}@keyframes tableau-svg-spinner-animation{100%{transform:rotate(360deg)}}</style><div id=\"tableau-svg-spinner-container-11\"><svg id=\"tableau-svg-spinner-11\" viewBox=\"0 0 50 50\"><style>#tail{fill:url(#tableau-fade-11)}#head{fill:#616570}stop{stop-color:#616570}</style><linearGradient id=\"tableau-fade-11\" x2=\"50\" y1=\"25\" y2=\"25\" gradientUnits=\"userSpaceOnUse\"><stop offset=\"0\" stop-opacity=\"0\"></stop><stop offset=\".15\" stop-opacity=\".04\"></stop><stop offset=\".3\" stop-opacity=\".16\"></stop><stop offset=\".45\" stop-opacity=\".36\"></stop><stop offset=\".61\" stop-opacity=\".64\"></stop><stop offset=\".76\"></stop></linearGradient><path id=\"head\" d=\"M0 25a25 25 0 1 0 50 0h-3.9a21.1 21.1 0 1 1-42.2 0\"></path><path id=\"tail\" d=\"M50 25a25 25 0 0 0-50 0h3.9a21.1 21.1 0 1 1 42.2 0\"></path></svg></div></div><div style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;right:0;bottom:0;z-index:990;background-color:#EBEBEB;opacity:.24\"></div><style>#tableau-svg-spinner-container-11{border-radius:12px;background:rgba(255,255,255,.6);</style><div style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; right: 0; bottom: 0; background: transparent url('https://public.tableau.com/static/images/PF/PFR_2020Exhibits148/PFRExhibit8/1.png?height=0&amp;width=0&amp;deviceScaleFactor=1') no-repeat scroll 0 0; background-size: 0px 0px; box-shadow: none; left:0px; top:1px\"></div></div><iframe frameborder=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" title=\"데이터 비주얼리제이션\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" class=\"tableauViz\" style=\"display: block; width: 100%; height: 927px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: none;\" width=\"300\" height=\"150\"></iframe></div>\n<p><script type=\"text/javascript\">                    var divElement = document.getElementById('viz1602879930503');                    var vizElement = divElement.getElementsByTagName('object')[0];                    if ( divElement.offsetWidth > 800 ) { vizElement.style.width='1000px';vizElement.style.height='827px';} else if ( divElement.offsetWidth > 500 ) { vizElement.style.width='100%';vizElement.style.height=(divElement.offsetWidth*0.75)+'px';} else { vizElement.style.width='100%';vizElement.style.height='927px';}                     var scriptElement = document.createElement('script');                    scriptElement.src = 'https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js';                    vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement);                </script></p>\n<p>Almost a third of total expenditures were spent on Protection of Persons and Property. Even as priorities have shifted and the economy has expanded, this percentage has remained remarkably stable.</p>\n<p>Also of note were the contributions to the City’s pension systems, which totaled $1.4 billion, 14.1 percent of total spending. This is up slightly from the prior year, and is expected to increase again as the impact of the market volatility is absorbed into the systems’ actuarial models. To the extent that the City is able to hold salary expenditures under long-term averages, the increase will be mitigated, but this issues should be monitored carefully.</p>\n<p>The City ended the fiscal year with a total of $779.2 million in encumbrances: &nbsp;$541.8 million in the General Fund and $237.4 million in special funds. $246.9 million was encumbered for salaries to be paid in July 2020, with the balance encumbered in expense, equipment, and special fund project accounts.</p>\n<p>Encumbered funds for salaries are earmarked for the last pay period of the fiscal year and unspent funds are immediately released after payroll is made. Funds encumbered for expense accounts are continued across fiscal years to ensure that cash is available to cover the expenditure when it is made. Schedule V provides a listing of General Fund encumbrances by department.</p>\n<p>The General Fund Encumbrance Policy provides that encumbered funds that remain unspent for a period longer than one fiscal year shall be disencumbered every fiscal year, with the exception of capital project funds. &nbsp;Prior-year encumbrances are automatically disencumbered unless exempted by Mayor and Council approval. As part of the 2019-20 Year-End Financial Status Report, a total of $57.1 million was exempted from disencumbrances, an increase of $18.2 million from last year’s exemptions. As noted in past years, this is an issue which deserves more attention.</p>\n<p>Unencumbered General funds revert to the Reserve Fund at year end. As such, exemptions to the automatic disencumbrance policy reduce reversions, thereby reducing the cash available in the Reserve Fund to pay for emergencies and contingencies. Section II below discusses the status of the Reserve Fund in more detail.</p>\n</div></div></div><div class=\"panel panel-default\"><div class=\"panel-heading active-accordion\"><a data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-parent=\"#1602779190\" href=\"#accordian-panel-4\"><h4 class=\"panel-title\">Section II: Reserve Fund<span class=\"pull-right\"><i class=\"fas fa-minus\"></i></span></h4></a></div><div id=\"accordian-panel-4\" class=\"panel-collapse collapsing\" style=\"height: 6426px;\"><div class=\"panel-body\"><p>The Reserve Fund is established to ensure that funds are available for unanticipated expenditures and revenue shortfalls in the General Fund, and is broken into an Emergency Account and a Contingency Account.</p>\n<p>The Emergency Reserve Account is fixed at 2.75 percent of the adopted General Fund receipts.

This was $19.8 million more than the amount anticipated in the 2020-21 Budget. The Reserve Fund cash balance is adjusted by the following factors to arrive at the year-end balance:</p>\n<p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Balance Before Year-End Reversions/Borrowings</span></p>\n<p>The amount of cash available in the Contingency Reserve prior to adjustments for year-end reversions, unallocated revenues, and borrowings. It does not include cash in the Emergency Reserve. For 2019-20, this amount was lower than anticipated in the budget due to higher than anticipated advances and non-reimbursable transfers to other funds made after the adoption of the budget.</p>\n<p>b.&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">General Fund Revenue Shortfall Funding</span></p>\n<p>As part of the Year-End Financial Status Report (C.F. 19-0600-S180), the Council authorized the Controller to transfer up to $288 million from the Reserve Fund to fully fund appropriations.&nbsp; The actual shortfall was $195.5 million, which was transferred from the Reserve Fund.</p>\n<p>c.&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Reversion of Uncommitted Balances</span></p>\n<p>Uncommitted General Fund appropriations are reverted to the Reserve Fund at fiscal year-end. Appropriations (spending authority) granted to City departments by the Mayor and Council are committed throughout the year in the form of encumbrances and expenditures. Remaining or uncommitted balances are reverted to the Reserve Fund to the extent that there is available cash in the General Fund.</p>\n<p>In 2019-20, the budget estimated $176.2 million in reversions. The uncommitted balance at year end was $224.9 million. Excluding unfunded appropriations, a total of $163.9 million reverted to the Reserve Fund. For a detailed breakdown of uncommitted balances by department, please see Schedule VII.</p>\n<p>d.&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Advances Under CF 19-0600-S179</span></p>\n<p>Council File 19-0600-S179 authorized the Controller to borrow from the Reserve Fund at year-end to balance departmental budgets where needed in order to facilitate the closing of the City’s General Ledger. The Controller is authorized to increase appropriations within established limits without getting itemized Mayor and Council approval, a process that would delay the closing of the City’s General Ledger. An advance of $500 was made to the General Services department.</p>\n<p>e.&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Advances Under Charter Section 261(i) for Unfunded Encumbrances and Expenditures</span></p>\n<p>Under Charter Section 261(i), the Controller transfers funds from the Reserve Fund as a loan to any fund that becomes depleted due to tardy receipt of revenue. The 2020-21 Budget estimated $50.0 million in year-end advances. Actual advances were $31.3 million, consisting of $17.1 million in unfunded expenditures and $14.2 million in unfunded encumbrances. See Schedule VIII for a breakdown by department.</p>\n<p>Unfunded expenditures generally occur when expenditures occur prior to receipts (e.g. grants on reimbursement basis) and/or due to billing delays. When the funding source reimburses the costs, departments are able to repay the advances. If funding is not available, departments may request Mayor and Council approval to write-off the advances. Unfunded encumbered amounts represent a technical adjustment at year-end and are reversed at the start of the new fiscal year as documented in item (f), below.</p>\n<p><strong><u>Reserve Fund Cash Balance (2020-21 Year-Start)</u></strong></p>\n<p>The 2019-20 year-end Reserve Fund cash balance is not the same as the 2020-21 year-start cash balance.

The ratio increased because the first Principal payment for Series 2018-A General Obligation Bonds, issued in 2018-19, was due in current year. This issuance provided funds in the amount of $276.2 million for Proposition HHH Housing and Homeless Facilities projects. Schedule IX shows the details of Outstanding General Obligation Bonded Debt.</p>\n<p>Exhibit 13 above shows very clearly the responsibility the City has exhibited when it comes to debt management. Good administration of debt service obligations has put the City in a position to consider major projects, as well as making strategic financing agreements available when these present financial advantages.</p>\n<p>This significant amount of debt capacity also indicates an opportunity to invest in large-scale long-term infrastructure projects, including both facility repair and replacement as well as new projects designed to stimulate economic development. Such an investment would also provide an opportunity to focus on regional equity, focusing investment in areas of the City which have often been left behind in prior initiatives. More generally, a significantly expanded capital program would serve as a fiscal stimulus for the entire region, adding jobs to a struggling economy and providing the infrastructure for future opportunity.</p>\n</div></div></div><div class=\"panel panel-default\"><div class=\"panel-heading active-accordion\"><a data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-parent=\"#1602779190\" href=\"#accordian-panel-7\"><h4 class=\"panel-title\">Section V: Recommendations<span class=\"pull-right\"><i class=\"fas fa-minus\"></i></span></h4></a></div><div id=\"accordian-panel-7\" class=\"panel-collapse collapsing\" style=\"height: 985px;\"><div class=\"panel-body\"><p>The current crisis demands decisive action on the part of the City’s leaders, who must simultaneously consider how to balance the City’s books in the short term and how to position the City to benefit in the long term. To this end, we make the following recommendations:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong><strong>Optimize the City’s revenue and rein in spending.</strong></strong>&nbsp;With the current recession having brought the travel and hospitality industries down by 70 to 80 percent, and funding streams related to parking and retail sales showing signs of significant slowdown, the City must work to get the most out of the revenue streams that are still coming in. At the same time, we must work together to find the least disruptive possible ways of reducing, or at least curtailing increases in, our spending.</li>\n<li><strong>Begin rebuilding the City’s Reserve Fund.</strong>&nbsp;Fiscal Year 2019-20 was a textbook example of why strong reserves are a critical piece of economic resilience. If the City had not spent the last decade building the Reserve Fund up above the 5 percent policy threshold, much more dramatic cuts would have been necessary right away, and our current position would be much more precarious. The time is now to start planning on how to begin growing these reserves again.</li>\n<li><strong>Leverage the City’s numerous assets.</strong>&nbsp;The City has vast resources of real property, talented people, and numerous special funds. All of these represent opportunities to develop and grow out of this recession. The alternative is to leave things as they are, ensuring that our recovery, and our City, will be less than it could be.</li>\n<li><strong><strong>Strongly consider a large expansion of the City’s capital program, focusing on critical needs as well as strategic opportunities to invest in historically disadvantaged neighborhoods and people.</strong></strong>&nbsp;As discussed in the section on Bonded Indebtedness, the City has legal capacity to borrow more than $8 billion for capital projects. While it would be unwise to ever use all, or even most, of this capacity, a significant investment in our infrastructure and our communities would reap benefits for generations to come.</li>\n</ol>\n</div></div></div><div class=\"panel panel-default\"><div class=\"panel-heading active-accordion\"><a data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-parent=\"#1602779190\"

    "textofpage": "Revised Revenue Forecast\n\nApril 15, 2020\n\nHonorable Mayor Eric Garcetti\nHonorable Members of the City Council\n\nLast month, my office submitted a Revenue Forecast report, which included revenue estimates for the remainder of the current fiscal year — ending June 30, 2020 — and projections for fiscal year 2021. At the time, we projected healthy revenue growth, but warned that unanticipated economic stress resulting from concerns about the coronavirus, along with rising employee-related expenses, could erase that growth quickly.\n\nSince then, the coronavirus has become a full-blown pandemic that has not just put stress on our local economy, but turned life across the United States — and the globe — upside down. Its impact has slowed the entire U.S. financial system; key industries, like travel and hospitality, have virtually come to a stop, leading noted economists to opine that we have already entered a deep and prolonged recession or worse. More than 17 million Americans filed for unemployment in just a four-week period as millions of businesses, both large and small, have closed their doors in an attempt to slow the spread of COVID-19. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said last week that the U.S. economy is in an emergency and deteriorating “with alarming speed.”\n\nOur first priority as City officials is to protect and preserve the health and safety of Los Angeles residents, something that we have all taken great pains to do. As City Controller, it is also my responsibility to monitor the state of the City’s finances and to update you and all Angelenos on any changes to the wellbeing of our public coffers. My hope is that these revised numbers will promote sober and responsible budget deliberations for the coming fiscal year.\n\nMy office has revised the current fiscal year’s General Fund revenue estimate downward by $231 million due to fallout from the coronavirus. This represents a 3.54 percent decrease from our previous March 1 estimate and well below the amount budgeted for the year. For fiscal year 2021, we now estimate a decline in projected General Fund revenues of between $194 million and $598 million, depending on the length of the current shutdown and the speed at which the economy begins to recover.\n\nFiscal year 2020\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the City’s adopted budget totals $10.71 billion; two-thirds of that, or $6.57 billion, consists of General Fund revenues. In early March 2020, my office projected General Fund receipts would come in at $6.61 billion; today, we are projecting those revenues to be $6.38 billion. Even with this revision, it is worth noting that my office is still projecting 2.3 percent growth over last fiscal year’s General Fund receipts.\n\nThe largest sources of the decrease this fiscal year are Transient Occupancy Tax (TOT) and Licenses, Permits, Fees and Fines (LPFF), which together are reduced by $110 million, as the travel and tourism industry has fallen by more than 70 percent and City office operations have been largely closed during the crisis. Revenues reflecting economic activity, such as Business Tax and Sales Tax, also are projected lower, but not to the same degree because both are lagging indicators that will be impacted much more heavily in the coming year. Economic forecasts show only a slight decline in the amount of Property Taxes, although this revenue may drop more sharply in future years if the recession extends through the end of the calendar year and home sales and values decrease.\n\nFiscal year 2021\n\nMy office is now presenting revenue projections for fiscal year 2021 as a range of possibilities with higher, middle and lower values attributed to each revenue stream. We are using ranges because the economic situation is uncertain and could remain so for months. It is unclear exactly when and how our economy will rebound and return to a state of normalcy. All estimates depend on what happens in the future — the higher values should not be considered a “best case” scenario and the lower values should not be considered a “worst case” scenario — these simply reflect estimates based on varying assumptions of the severity of the recession.\n\nWe currently project that General Fund receipts in 2021 will come in somewhere within the range of $6.22 billion and $6.62 billion, between $194 million and $598 million less than the $6.82 billion originally projected.\n\nUnless travel and business activity rebounds considerably, we will experience another slow year for TOT and significant drops in Business Tax, Sales Tax, and Parking Tax — roughly similar to what was experienced during the Great Recession from 2008 to 2010. Business Tax receipts will likely drop between eight and 12 percent, bringing in $55 million to $85 million less than projected. If any “tax holidays” are implemented, the actual receipts will be even lower.\n\nDifficult days ahead\n\nThe revenue outlook for Los Angeles is much darker than it was even a month ago, but it is not unique to our municipality. Cities and towns throughout California and the world are facing similar financial struggles — some much worse than ours as Los Angeles has diverse revenue streams and a healthy Reserve Fund balance.\n\nFor our great City, reductions in projected General Fund receipts will strain the ability to provide high quality services and necessitate difficult budgeting decisions next fiscal year and, potentially, for the foreseeable future. While protecting the welfare of Angelenos must always be our primary concern, it is also essential to ensure the City is fiscally responsible and secure.\n\nSincerely,\n\nRON GALPERIN\nL.A. Controller\n\nRead the previous Revenue Forecast Report released at the beginning of March 2020.",

At the time, we projected healthy revenue growth, but warned that unanticipated economic stress resulting from concerns about the coronavirus, along with rising employee-related expenses, could erase that growth quickly.</p>\n<p>Since then, the coronavirus has become a full-blown pandemic that has not just put stress on our local economy, but turned life across the United States — and the globe — upside down. Its impact has slowed the entire U.S. financial system; key industries, like travel and hospitality, have virtually come to a stop, leading noted economists to opine that we have already entered a deep and prolonged recession or worse. More than 17 million Americans filed for unemployment in just a four-week period as millions of businesses, both large and small, have closed their doors in an attempt to slow the spread of COVID-19. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said last week that the U.S. economy is in an emergency and deteriorating “with alarming speed.”</p>\n<p>Our first priority as City officials is to protect and preserve the health and safety of Los Angeles residents, something that we have all taken great pains to do. As City Controller, it is also my responsibility to monitor the state of the City’s finances and to update you and all Angelenos on any changes to the wellbeing of our public coffers. My hope is that these revised numbers will promote sober and responsible budget deliberations for the coming fiscal year.</p>\n<p><b>My office has revised the current fiscal year’s General Fund revenue estimate downward by $231 million due to fallout from the coronavirus. </b>This represents a 3.54 percent decrease from our previous March 1 estimate and well below the amount budgeted for the year.<b> For fiscal year 2021, we now estimate a decline in projected General Fund revenues of between $194 million and $598 million</b>, depending on the length of the current shutdown and the speed at which the economy begins to recover.</p>\n<h2><b>Fiscal year 2020</b></h2>\n<p>For the current fiscal year, the City’s adopted budget totals $10.71 billion; two-thirds of that, or $6.57 billion, consists of General Fund revenues. In early March 2020, my office projected General Fund receipts would come in at $6.61 billion; today, we are projecting those revenues to be $6.38 billion. Even with this revision, it is worth noting that my office is still projecting 2.3 percent growth over last fiscal year’s General Fund receipts.</p>\n<div id=\"viz1586930063172\" class=\"tableauPlaceholder\" style=\"position: relative; width: 624px; height: 271px; overflow: hidden; display: block;\"><noscript><a href='#'><img alt=' ' src='https://public.tableau.com/static/images/Re/RevisedRevenueForecastVisualizations/19-20Comparsion/1_rss.png' style='border: none' /></a></noscript><script src=\"https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js\"></script><div style=\"position: absolute; inset: 0px; border: 0px; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; transition: opacity 150ms ease 0s; opacity: 0;\"><div style=\"top:100px;left:0;right:0;position:absolute;z-index:991;box-shadow:none;display:flex;justify-content:center;\"><style>#tableau-svg-spinner-container-0{width:65px;height:65px;border-radius:10px;display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center}#tableau-svg-spinner-0{width:50px;height:50px;-webkit-animation:tableau-svg-spinner-animation 1s linear infinite;animation:tableau-svg-spinner-animation 1s linear infinite}@-webkit-keyframes tableau-svg-spinner-animation{100%{-webkit-transform:rotate(360deg)}}@keyframes tableau-svg-spinner-animation{100%{transform:rotate(360deg)}}</style><div id=\"tableau-svg-spinner-container-0\"><svg id=\"tableau-svg-spinner-0\" viewBox=\"0 0 50 50\"><style>#tail{fill:url(#tableau-fade-0)}#head{fill:#616570}stop{stop-color:#616570}</style><linearGradient id=\"tableau-fade-0\" x2=\"50\" y1=\"25\" y2=\"25\" gradientUnits=\"userSpaceOnUse\"><stop offset=\"0\" stop-opacity=\"0\"></stop><stop offset=\".15\" stop-opacity=\".04\"></stop><stop offset=\".3\" stop-opacity=\".16\"></stop><stop offset=\".45\" stop-opacity=\".36\"></stop><stop offset=\".61\" stop-opacity=\".64\"></stop><stop offset=\".76\"></stop></linearGradient><path id=\"head\" d=\"M0 25a25 25 0 1 0 50 0h-3.9a21.1 21.1 0 1 1-42.2 0\"></path><path id=\"tail\" d=\"M50 25a25 25 0 0 0-50 0h3.9a21.1 21.1 0 1 1 42.2 0\"></path></svg></div></div><div style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;right:0;bottom:0;z-index:990;background-color:#EBEBEB;opacity:.24\"></div><style>#tableau-svg-spinner-container-0{border-radius:12px;background:rgba(255,255,255,.6);</style><div style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; right: 0; bottom: 0; background: transparent url('https://public.tableau.com/static/images/Re/RevisedRevenueForecastVisualizations/19-20Comparsion/1.png?height=271&amp;width=624&amp;deviceScaleFactor=1') no-repeat scroll 0 0; background-size: 624px 271px; box-shadow: none; left:0px; top:1px\"></div></div><iframe frameborder=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" title=\"데이터 비주얼리제이션\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" class=\"tableauViz\" style=\"display: block; width: 624px; height: 271px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: none;\" width=\"300\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://public.tableau.com/views/RevisedRevenueForecastVisualizations/19-20Comparsion?:embed=y&amp;:showVizHome=no&amp;:host_url=https%3A%2F%2Fpublic.tableau.com%2F&amp;:embed_code_version=3&amp;:tabs=no&amp;:toolbar=yes&amp;:animate_transition=yes&amp;:display_static_image=no&amp;:display_spinner=no&amp;:display_overlay=yes&amp;:display_count=yes&amp;publish=yes&amp;:loadOrderID=0\"></iframe></div>\n<p><script type=\"text/javascript\">                    var divElement = document.getElementById('viz1586930063172');                    var vizElement = divElement.getElementsByTagName('object')[0];                    if ( divElement.offsetWidth > 800 ) { vizElement.style.width='100%';vizElement.style.height='271px';} else if ( divElement.offsetWidth > 500 ) { vizElement.style.width='624px';vizElement.style.height='271px';} else { vizElement.style.width='624px';vizElement.style.height='271px';}                     var scriptElement = document.createElement('script');                    scriptElement.src = 'https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js';                    vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement);                </script></p>\n<p>The largest sources of the decrease this fiscal year are Transient Occupancy Tax (TOT) and Licenses, Permits, Fees and Fines (LPFF), which together are reduced by $110 million, as the travel and tourism industry has fallen by more than 70 percent and City office operations have been largely closed during the crisis. Revenues reflecting economic activity, such as Business Tax and Sales Tax, also are projected lower, but not to the same degree because both are lagging indicators that will be impacted much more heavily in the coming year. Economic forecasts show only a slight decline in the amount of Property Taxes, although this revenue may drop more sharply in future years if the recession extends through the end of the calendar year and home sales and values decrease.</p>\n<div id=\"viz1586931666382\" class=\"tableauPlaceholder\" style=\"position: relative;

All estimates depend on what happens in the future — the higher values should not be considered a “best case” scenario and the lower values should not be considered a “worst case” scenario — these simply reflect estimates based on varying assumptions of the severity of the recession.</p>\n<div id=\"viz1586932059707\" class=\"tableauPlaceholder\" style=\"position: relative;

    "textofpage": "Report\n\nThe Revenue Forecast Report covers updated revenue estimates for the remainder of the current fiscal year — ending June 30, 2020 — and projections for fiscal year 2021. Although forecasts inherently involve some uncertainty, this report offers our best estimates based on the available information and seeks to promote responsible budgeting in the year ahead.\n\nAlso included in the report are the estimated requirements for debt service and General Fund cash flow borrowing.\n\nThe Revenue Forecast Report is issued pursuant to the Controller’s City Charter mandate to monitor and report on all matters relating to the City’s fiscal health, to keep the City’s official financial records and to supervise municipal expenditures.\n\nRevenue\nGeneral Fund\n\nThe City’s adopted budget for fiscal year 2020 totals $10.71 billion. Two-thirds of that is comprised of General Fund revenues, while the balance comes from hundreds of special purpose funds. General Fund receipts come from a wide variety of sources, the largest being property tax receipts. These represent just under one-third of all General Fund revenues.\n\nThe updated estimate for this fiscal year’s General Fund receipts is $6.61 billion, a six percent increase over last year. Revenues from property and cannabis business taxes are coming in higher than expected, but will be offset by projected shortfalls in hotel and the telephone users taxes.\n\nThe cannabis industry is projected to remit more than $80 million in business taxes to Los Angeles this year, in addition to sales tax receipts and permit revenue. This amount should continue to expand, if the City moves forward with its efforts to permit new cannabis businesses and better enforce against illegal sales.\n\nRevenue growth will likely be eclipsed by climbing expenditures this year due to the increased cost of employee salaries and benefits. Short-term fixes and small adjustments can bolster the City’s bottom line now, but any unanticipated economic stress in the future would put L.A. in a far more precarious financial situation.\n\nTotal 2021 General Fund revenues are projected to be $6.82 billion, 3.2 percent more than this year. The revenues driving the current year’s growth should continue to increase, but be partially offset again by the telephone users tax, which continues to fall each year.\n\nSpecial Funds\n\nSpecial fund revenues represent approximately 30 percent of total 2020 Adopted Budget receipts.\n\nTotal special fund revenues for fiscal year 2020 are estimated to be $3.26 billion, $400 million higher than the year prior, spurred by large increases in Sewer Service Charges, Stormwater Pollution Abatement Charges and Street Damage Restoration Fees (SDRF). In the next fiscal year, special fund revenues are projected to grow by $77 million to $3.34 billion, led by strong growth in Proposition A and Gas Tax revenues.\n\nThe City’s SDRF Fund is a special fund that the Controller’s Office audited in 2014. Because of fee changes accomplished by working with the City Council, SDRF receipts are projected to grow from a historical average of less than $10 million to more than $50 million this year.\n\nOverall, special fund receipts have increased faster than General Fund receipts for many years, giving the City an opportunity to address some of its most pressing priorities using special funds, instead of the General Fund. There is still a pressing need for the City to better manage these funds and bring more of them into the yearly budget process.\n\nClick on the bubbles in the visualization to see how the revenue source has changed over the years.\n\nNote that the 2021 values below are projected revenues, not actual receipts as 2021 is the coming fiscal year that begins on July 1, 2020.\n\nThis chart breaks down City revenues by category from 2009 to 2019.\n\nDebt\n\nThe estimated City debt service requirement for fiscal year 2021 is $587 million.\n\nOf that, $129 million is for principal and interest payments on the City’s roughly $901 million in outstanding General Obligation Bonds.\n\nIn total, debt service is projected to be 4.96 percent of projected 2021 General Fund receipts, well under the 15 percent limit set by the City’s debt policy.\n\nDownload the data\n\nClick here to download the City’s revenue data on our Open Data portal.",

Although forecasts inherently involve some uncertainty, this report offers our best estimates based on the available information and seeks to promote responsible budgeting in the year ahead.</p>\n<p>Also included in the report are the estimated requirements for debt service and General Fund cash flow borrowing.</p>\n<p>The Revenue Forecast Report is issued pursuant to the Controller’s City Charter mandate to monitor and report on all matters relating to the City’s fiscal health, to keep the City’s official financial records and to supervise municipal expenditures.</p>\n<hr>\n<h1>Revenue</h1>\n<h2>General Fund</h2>\n<p>The City’s adopted budget for fiscal year 2020 totals $10.71 billion. Two-thirds of that is comprised of General Fund revenues, while the balance comes from hundreds of special purpose funds. General Fund receipts come from a wide variety of sources, the largest being property tax receipts. These represent just under one-third of all General Fund revenues.</p>\n<p>The updated estimate for this fiscal year’s General Fund receipts is $6.61 billion, a six percent increase over last year. Revenues from property and cannabis business taxes are coming in higher than expected, but will be offset by projected shortfalls in hotel and the telephone users taxes.</p>\n<p>The cannabis industry is projected to remit more than $80 million in business taxes to Los Angeles this year, in addition to sales tax receipts and permit revenue. This amount should continue to expand, if the City moves forward with its efforts to permit new cannabis businesses and better enforce against illegal sales.</p>\n<p>Revenue growth will likely be eclipsed by climbing expenditures this year due to the increased cost of employee salaries and benefits. Short-term fixes and small adjustments can bolster the City’s bottom line now, but any unanticipated economic stress in the future would put L.A. in a far more precarious financial situation.</p>\n<p>Total 2021 General Fund revenues are projected to be $6.82 billion, 3.2 percent more than this year. The revenues driving the current year’s growth should continue to increase, but be partially offset again by the telephone users tax, which continues to fall each year.</p>\n<h2>Special Funds</h2>\n<p>Special fund revenues represent approximately 30 percent of total 2020 Adopted Budget receipts.</p>\n<p>Total special fund revenues for fiscal year 2020 are estimated to be $3.26 billion, $400 million higher than the year prior, spurred by large increases in Sewer Service Charges, Stormwater Pollution Abatement Charges and Street Damage Restoration Fees (SDRF). In the next fiscal year, special fund revenues are projected to grow by $77 million to $3.34 billion, led by strong growth in Proposition A and Gas Tax revenues.</p>\n<p>The City’s SDRF Fund is a special fund that the Controller’s Office audited in 2014. Because of fee changes accomplished by working with the City Council, SDRF receipts are projected to grow from a historical average of less than $10 million to more than $50 million this year.</p>\n<p>Overall, special fund receipts have increased faster than General Fund receipts for many years, giving the City an opportunity to address some of its most pressing priorities using special funds, instead of the General Fund. There is still a pressing need for the City to better manage these funds and bring more of them into the yearly budget process.</p>\n<p>Click on the bubbles in the visualization to see how the revenue source has changed over the years.</p>\n<p><em>Note that the 2021 values below are projected revenues, not actual receipts as 2021 is the coming fiscal year that begins on July 1, 2020.</em></p>\n<div id=\"viz1582321592272\" class=\"tableauPlaceholder\" style=\"position: relative;

Each year, my office produces the Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (CAFR), which gives a complete financial picture of the City, including revenues, expenditures, assets and liabilities. The CAFR, along with the City’s Annual Budget and the City Administrative Officer’s financial status reports, is fundamental to understanding the City’s financial opportunities and challenges. On this page is the more accessible version of the report, the Popular Annual Financial Report (PAFR), which presents the data in an easier-to-read format so that everyone can understand the finances of the City.</p>\n<p>Here’s a snapshot of the City’s finances for fiscal year 2019:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>$18.2 billion total City revenues, a 13.7 percent uptick over the year prior.</li>\n<li>$15.1 billion in expenses, a 7.5 increase over the year prior.</li>\n<li>$5.6 billion in General Fund revenues, a 7.4 percent increase over the year prior.</li>\n<li>$23.2 billion net position, a 15.6 percent increase over the year prior.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Our report also features charts with data that measures the performance of City departments. These help elucidate how well the City is using its finances to serve the public year over year. Here are some quick facts from the City Activities section below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>17,648 youth were placed in employment through HireLA, 850 more than the previous year.</li>\n<li>25,368 fatal and injury traffic accidents occurred, while the number of traffic citations continued to fall to the lowest number since at least 2010.</li>\n<li>35,543 animals were adopted from City shelters, while the number of animals euthanized declined to 6,427.</li>\n<li>350,000 people attended library cultural programming, a decline of more than 5,000 from the year prior.</li>\n<li>2.8 million people swam in City pools, an increase of 172,500 over the year before.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This information is just a taste of what you’ll find on this page. Our goals are to educate Angelenos on the finances of the City by being as transparent as possible and empower them to be better advocates for their communities.

Program revenues are resources obtained from parties outside of the City and charges for services between the governmental and business-type activities.</p>\n<p>Total expenses increased by $246.8 million or 3.5% above fiscal year 2018. Increased expenses were due primarily to increases in health and sanitation of $108.9 million, community development of $79.3 million, and cultural and recreational services of $32.2 million, offset by a combined decrease of $49.3 million in public works and protection of persons and property. Interest on long-term debt posted an increase of $18.5 million.</p>\n<p><strong>Business-Type Activities</strong><br>\nThe $9.0 billion combined operating revenues of the City’s six business-type activities were $1.3 billion more than the $7.7 billion combined operating costs.</p>\n<p><strong>Business-Type Activities: Change in Net Position</strong><br>\nEnterprise funds are used to report the functions presented as business-type activities in the government-wide financial statements, they are generally used to account for services for which the City charges customers – either outside customers or other departments/funds of the City. All of the City’s enterprise funds, except the convention center, are considered major funds.

    "textofpage": "Interactive Preliminary Financial Report 2019\n\nA first look at the City’s financial performance in the fiscal year ending June 30, 2019\n\nIn May 2018, the City Council approved a budget of $9.9 billion for the fiscal year from July 1, 2018 through June 30, 2019. The Preliminary Financial Report provides data and analysis of the City’s revenues and expenditures for that fiscal year. It details where the City’s budgeted funds came from, how they were spent and more.\n\nWhy Is This Report Important?\n\nOne of the City Controller’s primary responsibilities is analyzing and reporting on the City’s finances. The reports produced by the Controller inform City officials and the public about the City’s financial activities and financial status. They also aim to initiate meaningful reflection and debate about the City’s fiscal management.\n\nThe Preliminary Financial Report, made available each October after the City’s books are closed, is the first of these reports. It provides information on how the City spent its funds over the past fiscal year, featuring data and analysis of the City’s revenues and expenditures, the Reserve Fund, the Budget Stabilization Fund, and the City’s bonded indebtedness.\n\nMore complete and detailed information, presented in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Practices will be published in the Comprehensive Annual Financial Report in January 2020. Below is an interactive version of the Preliminary Financial Report followed by the full report. You can also download a pdf of the full report on the right side of this page.\n\nData Visualizations\nRevenues\n\nDuring the 2018-19 fiscal year, revenue grew by 7.2% in the General Fund and 11.6% in on-budget special funds. This was led by all-time high receipts from Property Tax, Business Tax, Sales Tax, and Licenses, Permits, Fees, and Fines. Combining General Fund and on-budget special fund revenue, total revenue increased by 8.6% over 2017-18.\n\nView this interactive data visualization to explore the relative size of the City’s revenue sources and their growth over the past 10 years.\n\nExpenditures\n\nTotal expenditures grew at a rate of 4.5%, due in large part to salary and benefit increases. Expenditures are projected to accelerate in the next year, with newly-executed employment contracts for almost every City employee guaranteeing pay increases, as well as projected increases in health care costs and retirement contributions.\n\nThis interactive data visualization compares the expenditures of the City’s different departments, as well as non-departmental expenditures, over the past 10 years. View total expenditures, salaries, other expenditures, descriptions of each item, and the change of each item over time.\n\nReserve Fund and Budget Stabilization Fund\n\nIt is crucial that the City build up reserve funds during years of strong growth in order to prepare for future downturns. In the last ten fiscal years, the City’s Reserve Fund rose from 3.9% in July 2009 to its 8.2% peak at the beginning of 2015-16, but has since declined to 6.2% of the 2018-19 Adopted General Fund Budget.\n\nReserve Fund\n\nThe Reserve Fund is established to ensure that funds are available for unanticipated expenditures and revenue shortfalls in the General Fund. The City’s Reserve Fund Policy sets a goal for the Reserve Fund of at least 5% of the General Fund budget every year.\n\nOn July 1, 2019, the Reserve Fund had a balance of $404.3 million, 6.2% of the 2019-2020 General Fund budget and $79 million above the 5% Reserve Fund Policy goal.\n\nBudget Stabilization Fund\n\nThe Budget Stabilization Fund (BSF) was added to the City Charter in 2011. The purpose of the BSF is to set aside funds when revenue projections are exceeded to help smooth out years when revenue is stagnant or is in decline. In fiscal year 2019, the BSF grew slightly to $107.2 million but stayed about flat as a percentage of General Fund revenues. For the 2020 fiscal year, the adopted budget set aside $7 million to be deposited into the BSF.\n\nClick the chart below to view the performance of the Reserve Fund and Budget Stabilization Fund, both in dollar terms and as a percentage of budgeted General Fund revenues.\n\nDebt\n\nThe City’s Debt Management Policy establishes guidelines for the structure and management of the City’s debt obligations. These guidelines include a non-voter-approved debt service cap of 6% and a total debt service cap of 15% as a percent of General Fund revenues.\n\nThe City’s total indebtedness and debt service obligations increased slightly for the first time since 2012, due primarily to the issuance of Proposition HHH General Obligation Bonds.\n\n \n\nFull Preliminary Financial Report\n\nOctober 17, 2019\n\nHonorable Eric Garcetti, Mayor\nHonorable Members of the Los Angeles City Council\n\nRe: Preliminary Financial Report for Fiscal Year 2018-19\n\nEach fall, the Controller’s office submits the Preliminary Financial Report covering financial operations for the City of Los Angeles for the previous fiscal year. Our report is the City’s first review of municipal finances after the close of the fiscal year, providing an overview and analysis of revenues and expenditures, reserves and bonded indebtedness. In January 2020, my office will follow up by issuing the City’s Comprehensive Annual Financial Report for 2018-19, which is prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles and externally audited by a firm of certified public accountants.\n\nAccompanying the current Preliminary Financial Report is an online interactive tool for exploring revenues and expenditures, with 10 years of data. Information on special fund balances and uses, Reserve Fund starting balances over the years, and budget appropriations, adjustments, expenditures and revenues, are also available on our website.\n\nThe substance and timing of this report make it a vital tool for City leaders to use to assess the overall health of the City’s finances. Knowledge and understanding of the revenue and expenditure trends, the condition of the City’s reserves, and the outstanding debt — all of which are discussed in the report — are critical to ensuring responsible financial management.\n\nA solid year\n\nHighlighted in the Preliminary Financial Report are these facts about the 2018-19 fiscal year:\n\nTotal revenues increased by 8.6 percent to $9.08 billion, while total expenditures rose by 4.5 percent to $8.23 billion. Revenue growth was fueled by all-time high property, business, sales and transient occupancy tax receipts.\nGeneral Fund revenues grew by 7.2 percent to $6.23 billion, while non-proprietary special funds expanded by 11.6 percent to $2.85.\nThe Reserve Fund balance ended at 6.2 percent of General Fund receipts anticipated in the 2019-20 Adopted Budget, leaving the City $79 million above its five percent policy goal.\nCannabis related revenue totaled more than $70 million due to higher than expected business and sales tax receipts.\n\nConcerns remain\n\nA number of concerns are also addressed in the report:\n\nPension costs to the City increased last fiscal year by 9.1 percent from $1.1 billion to more than $1.2 billion.\nTotal expenditures will continue to grow in the coming years due to increased salary and employee benefit costs in newly-adopted labor agreements. Such costs could put constraints on the City’s ability to expand services in future years, especially if revenues do not keep pace.\nAlthough transient occupancy tax receipts from hotels and home-sharing increased, they dipped below budgeted amounts for the first time since 2011. The City’s new home-sharing policy, which imposes some limits on short term rentals, could impact the amount collected going forward.\n\nTo proactively address these issues, my office recommends that the City further increase the General Fund percentage contributed to the Reserve and Budget Stabilization Funds, and remain cautious when considering future staffing and related spending requests.\n\nIt is also worth noting that City’s debt service requirements increased only slightly to 5.5 percent of General Fund revenues ($345.6 million), due to the issuance of the second round of Proposition HHH bonds last year, but remained significantly below the policy limit of 15 percent ($935.5 million). While this can be viewed in a positive light, utilizing debt financing can also provide the opportunity to invest in large-scale infrastructure projects to meet long-term City needs, including street and sidewalk repair and information technology modernization, as recommended in some of my office’s recent reports.\n\nMy staff and I appreciate the cooperation shown by City departments as we prepared this report, and we congratulate them for smoothly closing the last fiscal year.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nL.A. Controller\n\ncc:    Sharon Tso, Chief Legislative Analyst\nRichard H. Llewellyn Jr., City Administrative Officer\n\n[/bg_collapse]\n\nExecutive Summary\n\nAt the close of each fiscal year, the Office of the Controller is required to report on the finances of the City for the year that just ended. This Preliminary Financial Report is the first piece of that reporting provides cash basis information on revenues, expenditures, reserves, and bonded indebtedness, in comparison to the Adopted Budget.\n\nREAD MORE\nSection I: Revenues and Expenditures\n\nThe Preliminary Financial Report focuses on the cash basis financial information of the City for 2018-19, providing information on revenues and expenditures, the Reserve Fund, the Budget Stabilization Fund, and bonded indebtedness.\n\nAudited financial statements, prepared in conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), will be presented in the City’s Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (CAFR) later this fiscal year.\n\nREAD MORE\nSection II: Reserve Fund\n\nThe Reserve Fund is established to ensure that funds are available for unanticipated expenditures and revenue shortfalls in the General Fund, and is broken into an Emergency Account and a Contingency Account.\n\nThe Emergency Reserve Account is fixed at 2.75 percent of the adopted General Fund receipts. A finding of urgent economic necessity is required to use these funds. The Contingency Reserve Account includes all monies in the Reserve Fund over and above the amount required to be allocated to the Emergency Account. Contingency Reserve Account funds can be a source of additional funding to cover unanticipated expenses or revenue shortfalls.\n\nREAD MORE\nSection III: Budget Stabilization Fund\n\nThe Budget Stabilization Fund (BSF) was added to the City’s Charter in 2011. The purpose of this fund is to set aside revenues during periods of robust economic growth or when revenue projections are exceeded to help smooth out years when revenue is stagnant or is in decline.\n\nREAD MORE\nSection IV: Bonded Indebtedness\n\nThe City’s Debt Management Policy establishes guidelines for the structure and management of the City’s debt obligations. These guidelines include target and ceiling levels for certain debt ratios to be used for planning purposes. The two most significant ratios are a non-voter-approved debt service cap as a percent of General Fund revenues of 6 percent and a total debt service cap as a percent of General Fund revenues of 15 percent.\n\nREAD MORE\nSchedules\nREAD MORE",

Knowledge and understanding of the revenue and expenditure trends, the condition of the City’s reserves, and the outstanding debt — all of which are discussed in the report — are critical to ensuring responsible financial management.</p>\n<p><b>A solid year</b></p>\n<p>Highlighted in the Preliminary Financial Report are these facts about the 2018-19 fiscal year:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Total revenues increased by 8.6 percent to $9.08 billion, while total expenditures rose by 4.5 percent to $8.23 billion. Revenue growth was fueled by all-time high property, business, sales and transient occupancy tax receipts.</li>\n<li>General Fund revenues grew by 7.2 percent to $6.23 billion, while non-proprietary special funds expanded by 11.6 percent to $2.85.</li>\n<li>The Reserve Fund balance ended at 6.2 percent of General Fund receipts anticipated in the 2019-20 Adopted Budget, leaving the City $79 million above its five percent policy goal.</li>\n<li>Cannabis related revenue totaled more than $70 million due to higher than expected business and sales tax receipts.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Concerns remain</b></p>\n<p>A number of concerns are also addressed in the report:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Pension costs to the City increased last fiscal year by 9.1 percent from $1.1 billion to more than $1.2 billion.</li>\n<li>Total expenditures will continue to grow in the coming years due to increased salary and employee benefit costs in newly-adopted labor agreements. Such costs could put constraints on the City’s ability to expand services in future years, especially if revenues do not keep pace.</li>\n<li>Although transient occupancy tax receipts from hotels and home-sharing increased, they dipped below budgeted amounts for the first time since 2011. The City’s new home-sharing policy, which imposes some limits on short term rentals, could impact the amount collected going forward.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To proactively address these issues, my office recommends that the City further increase the General Fund percentage contributed to the Reserve and Budget Stabilization Funds, and remain cautious when considering future staffing and related spending requests.</p>\n<p>It is also worth noting that City’s debt service requirements increased only slightly to 5.5 percent of General Fund revenues ($345.6 million), due to the issuance of the second round of Proposition HHH bonds last year, but remained significantly below the policy limit of 15 percent ($935.5 million). While this can be viewed in a positive light, utilizing debt financing can also provide the opportunity to invest in large-scale infrastructure projects to meet long-term City needs, including street and sidewalk repair and information technology modernization, as recommended in some of my office’s recent reports.</p>\n<p>My staff and I appreciate the cooperation shown by City departments as we prepared this report, and we congratulate them for smoothly closing the last fiscal year.</p>\n<p>Respectfully submitted,</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-520\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20192%2067'%3E%3C/svg%3E\" alt=\"\" width=\"192\" height=\"67\" data-lazy-srcset=\"https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/lacontroller-2b7de.appspot.com/o/photos%2Fsignatures%2Fron-galperin-signature.png?alt=media&token=558de178-1903-41c0-854c-e1ecfdafda5a 192w, https://lacontroller.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/ron-galperin-signature-81x28.png 81w\" data-lazy-sizes=\"(max-width: 192px) 100vw, 192px\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/lacontroller-2b7de.appspot.com/o/photos%2Fsignatures%2Fron-galperin-signature.png?alt=media&token=558de178-1903-41c0-854c-e1ecfdafda5a\"><noscript><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-520\" src=\"https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/lacontroller-2b7de.appspot.com/o/photos%2Fsignatures%2Fron-galperin-signature.png?alt=media&token=558de178-1903-41c0-854c-e1ecfdafda5a\" alt=\"\" width=\"192\" height=\"67\" srcset=\"https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/lacontroller-2b7de.appspot.com/o/photos%2Fsignatures%2Fron-galperin-signature.png?alt=media&token=558de178-1903-41c0-854c-e1ecfdafda5a 192w, https://lacontroller.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/ron-galperin-signature-81x28.png 81w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 192px) 100vw, 192px\" /></noscript></p>\n<p>L.A.

Together, these two documents educate and inform both City decision-makers and the public on the City’s financial situation.</p>\n<p>Fiscal Year 2018-19, which ended on June 30, 2019, was a strong year for the City’s finances. Total revenues grew faster than historical averages, while total expenditures grew slightly less than the long-term trend. Reserves were maintained well above the City’s policy minimums and debt service obligations remained far below legal limits. However, as discussed in the Report, newly-contracted salary increases, continuing demands for expanded services, and other future obligations will make this strength difficult to maintain in the years to come, while crowding out much needed investment in critical infrastructure maintenance and improvement.</p>\n<p><strong>Fiscal Year 2019 at a Glance</strong></p>\n<p>Strengths:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Total Revenues up 8.6% while Total Expenditures up 4.5%</li>\n<li>2% Reserve Fund provides more than $209 million for contingencies.</li>\n<li>Health costs increased by only 5%, slower than prior years.</li>\n<li>Cannabis-related revenue totaled over $70 million.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Weaknesses:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Pension costs grew by 9.1%</li>\n<li>Capital Improvements spending only 44% of budget</li>\n<li>Documentary Transfer Tax fell slightly for the second straight year</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Trends to Watch:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>New MOUs will increase salaries significantly</li>\n<li>Will hotel demand and prices stay high? And what impact will the new home-sharing policy have on tax revenue?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>With sales volumes falling, can Property Tax continue to grow at more than 6% annually?</p>\n<p>The Preliminary Financial Report is organized in four distinct sections:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Revenues and Expenditures</strong>: A discussion of the fiscal year that just ended, including trend analysis, notable changes from prior years, and financial performance relative to the Adopted Budget</li>\n<li><strong><u>Reserve Fund</u></strong>: A discussion of the current condition of the City’s Reserve Fund, and analysis of the various factors influencing that figure</li>\n<li><strong><u>Budget Stabilization Fund</u></strong>: A discussion of the Fund policy and how actual figures compare to the policy</li>\n<li><strong><u>Bonded Indebtedness</u></strong>: A statement of the City’s total bonded indebtedness and debt service requirements; as well as comparisons to City policies and legal limitations</li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li><strong><u>Revenues and Expenditures</u></strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Total Revenue grew by 8.6 percent over the prior year. General Fund revenue increased by 7.2 percent, led by record high receipts from Property Tax, Business Tax, Sales Tax, and Licenses, Permits, Fees, and Fines. Revenue in budgeted special funds increased by 11.6 percent, led by Sewer Construction and Maintenance, Solid Waste Resources, and the first full year of the Road Maintenance and Rehabilitation Program (SB 1).</p>\n<p>Total expenditures grew as well, at a rate of 4.5 percent, led by salary and pension contribution increases partially offset by reduced spending on capital projects.</p>\n<p>Revenues have been growing at a relatively strong pace for a number of years, but signs of weakening are present, including stagnant receipts from Documentary Transfer Tax and Transient Occupancy Tax from hotels. Expenditures, however, are projected to grow at a higher rate over the next two years due to new employment contracts with virtually all City employees including significant cost of living increases over the next three years, in addition to projected increases in health care costs and retirement contributions.</p>\n<p>Combining these projected increases with the constant demands for greater service levels and new initiatives, and deferred maintenance, the City may face significant challenges when the impacts of a slowing national and international economy begin to negatively affect the City’s revenues.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong><u>Reserve Fund</u></strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>The key to preparing for future downturns is to increase the City’s reserves during years of strong growth. In the last ten fiscal years, with a combination of strong revenue growth and fiscal restraint, the Reserve Fund balance rose from 3.9 percent in 2009-10 to its 8.2 percent peak at the beginning of 2015-16, but has since declined to 6.2 percent of the 2019-20 Adopted General Fund Budget.</p>\n<p>Since 2015, efforts to balance the budget, fund new priorities and cover unanticipated expenditures have cut into these reserves. While this amount is above the City’s policy goals, the decline in reserves does not correlate to the significant economic growth the City has experienced during this period. The current balance in the Reserve Fund leaves $79 million available to meet unanticipated needs without dropping below the City’s 5 percent Reserve Fund policy.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><strong><u>Budget Stabilization Fund</u></strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>The Budget Stabilization Fund is the City’s mechanism for accumulating excess tax revenues in growth years in order to mitigate shortfalls in lean years. The June 30, 2019 balance in the Fund was $107.2 million. As in prior years, deposits into the Fund were reduced in order to meet other City Financial Policies, notably the capital improvement funding requirement, though even with the offsets the budget is not in compliance with the policy. The Mayor and Council are currently working with the City Administrative Officer (CAO) and the City Attorney to revise the policy to better reflect the City’s needs and financial situation.</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li><strong><u>Bonded Indebtedness</u></strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>After four consecutive years of decreases driven by low interest rates and debt refunding, bonded indebtedness and the City’s debt service obligations increased due to the issuance of Proposition HHH bonds. Debt service payments increased from 5.4 percent to 5.5 percent of General Fund revenue, still well under the City’s 15 percent policy ceiling.</p>\n<p>This low level of debt, combined with historically low interest rates, presents the possibility of debt financing much needed improvements in City facilities, technology infrastructure, and street, sidewalk, and safety projects. As long as additional debt is issued responsibly and strategically, this can be a valuable tool for financing long term investment in the City’s future.</p>\n<p></p></div></div><a id=\"bg-showmore-action-6399f17601ea84068706975\" class=\"bg-showmore-plg-link bg-   \" style=\"color:#52A2F3;; \" href=\"#\">Read More</a>\n</div><div id=\"revenues\" class=\"main-content-text-to-spacer\"><h1><strong>Section I: Revenues and Expenditures</strong></h1>\n<p>The Preliminary Financial Report focuses on the cash basis financial information of the City for 2018-19, providing information on revenues and expenditures, the Reserve Fund, the Budget Stabilization Fund, and bonded indebtedness.</p>\n<p>Audited financial statements, prepared in conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), will be presented in the City’s Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (CAFR) later this fiscal year.</p>\n<div><input type=\"hidden\" bg_collapse_expand_pro=\"6399f176028e63073910924\" value=\"6399f176028e63073910924\"><input type=\"hidden\" id=\"bg-show-more-text-6399f176028e63073910924\" value=\"Read More\"><input type=\"hidden\" id=\"bg-show-less-text-6399f176028e63073910924\" value=\"Read Less\"><input type=\"hidden\" id=\"bg-icon-bg-color-6399f176028e63073910924\" value=\"\"><div id=\"bg-showmore-pro-hidden-6399f176028e63073910924\" class=\"bg-showmore-closed \"><p></p>\n<p>Total Revenues in budgeted funds for 2018-19 were $9.08 billion, an increase of 8.6 percent over 2017-18, while total expenditures increased by 4.5 percent to $8.23 billion. In addition to the expenditures, the City encumbered $618 million. However, with recently approved cost of living increases, many of which are retroactive, along with projected increases in other costs, the gap between revenues and expenditures will shrink in future years unless revenues exceed expectations.

However, as seen in Exhibit 1, the two sides never diverge for very long. When expenditures exceed revenues, the City implements costs controls and seeks new revenue sources; when revenues exceed expenditures, new and expanded initiatives get funded.</p>\n<p>The 2018-19 Adopted Budget totaled $9.16 billion (excluding $740.9 million in available balances), of which $6.19 billion was in the General Fund and $2.97 billion was in Special Funds. Actual receipts for the year (excluding available balances) were $9.08 billion, 0.76 percent less than budgeted, while total expenditures (including encumbrances) were $8.84 billion, 10.7 percent less than budgeted.

Ex-CRA property tax increment revenue was $23.3 million less than budget and $14.5 million less than the prior year due to delayed property sales and an anticipated tax settlement that was not completed during the fiscal year.</p>\n<p>The Adopted Budget assumed 6.4 percent growth for Business Tax receipts. However, due to greater market share of recreational cannabis retail activity ($43.5 million or 7.2 percent of total Business Tax) and moderate growth in non-cannabis business tax, actual receipts were 8.8 percent higher than last year and $13.1 million over budget.</p>\n<p>New cannabis retail activity had a positive effect on Sales Tax Receipts as well. Along with delayed prior year remittances and out of state receipts, Sales Tax receipts exceeded the budget by $23.5 million or 4.2 percent, increasing to a total of $581.4 million.</p>\n<p>Franchise Income ended higher than budget by $5.5 million, mainly due to natural gas and cable franchise fees that exceeded budget by $3.2 and $1.6 million respectively.</p>\n<p>Utility Users’ Tax had a net increase of 0.4 percent. While Gas Users and Electrical Users Taxes combined exceeded the budget by $19.6 million, Telephone Users Tax receipts were $17 million under budget, continuing a decade-long downward trend as both telephone prices and usage decline.</p>\n<p>After two consecutive years of shortfalls, Licenses, Permits, Fees and Fines ended slightly higher than budget ($1.7 million or 0.15 percent), boosted by an unbudgeted $26.9 million one-time payment from the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy relative to Taylor Yard.</p>\n<p>These higher than expected revenues were offset by shortfalls in a number of other categories.</p>\n<p>Transient Occupancy Tax (commonly known as Hotel Tax) receipts increased by 6.6 percent over last year, but fell under budget first time since 2011, missing the target by $3.3 million or 1 percent. While Transient Occupancy Tax receipts from hotels grew only 2.9 percent, total growth was driven up by revenues collected from short-term rental companies under negotiated tax collection agreements. It should be noted that the City’s newly-implemented home-sharing policy, which will restrict the number of properties and rental days that private dwellings will be available on short term rental market, may impact Transient Occupancy Tax going forward.</p>\n<p>Documentary Transfer Tax receipts were short $8.3 million or 3.9 percent compared to the budget and $1.6 million or 0.8 percent compared to last year. This second straight slight decrease was a result of declining sales offset by continuing increases in sale prices.</p>\n<p>The Power Revenue Transfer was $5.4 million (2.3 percent) less than budget. It has been declining slowly since 2016, with a 4.4 percent average decrease over the last three years.</p>\n<p>Exhibit 4 below displays a 10-year history of General Fund receipts, excluding transfers from Reserve Fund.</p>\n<div id=\"viz1571169397157\" class=\"tableauPlaceholder\" style=\"position: relative; width: 1000px; height: 827px; overflow: hidden; display: block;\"><noscript><a href='#'><img alt=' ' src='https://public.tableau.com/static/images/PF/PFR_2019Exhibit4/GeneralFundRevenues/1_rss.png' style='border: none' /></a></noscript><script src=\"https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js\"></script><object class=\"tableauViz\" style=\"display: none; width: 1000px; height: 827px;\" width=\"300\" height=\"150\"><param name=\"host_url\" value=\"https%3A%2F%2Fpublic.tableau.com%2F\"><param name=\"embed_code_version\" value=\"3\"><param name=\"site_root\" value=\"\"><param name=\"name\" value=\"PFR_2019Exhibit4/GeneralFundRevenues\"><param name=\"tabs\" value=\"no\"><param name=\"toolbar\" value=\"yes\"><param name=\"static_image\" value=\"https://public.tableau.com/static/images/PF/PFR_2019Exhibit4/GeneralFundRevenues/1.png\"><param name=\"animate_transition\" value=\"yes\"><param name=\"display_static_image\" value=\"yes\"><param name=\"display_spinner\" value=\"yes\"><param name=\"display_overlay\" value=\"yes\"><param name=\"display_count\" value=\"yes\"></object><div style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;right:0;bottom:0;border:0;padding:0;margin:0\"><div style=\"top:100px;left:0;right:0;position:absolute;z-index:991;box-shadow:none;display:flex;justify-content:center;\"><style>#tableau-svg-spinner-container-3{width:65px;height:65px;border-radius:10px;display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center}#tableau-svg-spinner-3{width:50px;height:50px;-webkit-animation:tableau-svg-spinner-animation 1s linear infinite;animation:tableau-svg-spinner-animation 1s linear infinite}@-webkit-keyframes tableau-svg-spinner-animation{100%{-webkit-transform:rotate(360deg)}}@keyframes tableau-svg-spinner-animation{100%{transform:rotate(360deg)}}</style><div id=\"tableau-svg-spinner-container-3\"><svg id=\"tableau-svg-spinner-3\" viewBox=\"0 0 50 50\"><style>#tail{fill:url(#tableau-fade-3)}#head{fill:#616570}stop{stop-color:#616570}</style><linearGradient id=\"tableau-fade-3\" x2=\"50\" y1=\"25\" y2=\"25\" gradientUnits=\"userSpaceOnUse\"><stop offset=\"0\" stop-opacity=\"0\"></stop><stop offset=\".15\" stop-opacity=\".04\"></stop><stop offset=\".3\" stop-opacity=\".16\"></stop><stop offset=\".45\" stop-opacity=\".36\"></stop><stop offset=\".61\" stop-opacity=\".64\"></stop><stop offset=\".76\"></stop></linearGradient><path id=\"head\" d=\"M0 25a25 25 0 1 0 50 0h-3.9a21.1 21.1 0 1 1-42.2 0\"></path><path id=\"tail\" d=\"M50 25a25 25 0 0 0-50 0h3.9a21.1 21.1 0 1 1 42.2 0\"></path></svg></div></div><div style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;right:0;bottom:0;z-index:990;background-color:#EBEBEB;opacity:.24\"></div><style>#tableau-svg-spinner-container-3{border-radius:12px;background:rgba(255,255,255,.6);</style><div style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; right: 0; bottom: 0; background: transparent url('https://public.tableau.com/static/images/PF/PFR_2019Exhibit4/GeneralFundRevenues/1.png?height=0&amp;width=0&amp;deviceScaleFactor=1') no-repeat scroll 0 0; background-size: 0px 0px; box-shadow: none; left:0px; top:1px\"></div></div><iframe frameborder=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" title=\"데이터 비주얼리제이션\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" class=\"tableauViz\" style=\"display: block; width: 1000px; height: 827px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: none;\" width=\"300\" height=\"150\"></iframe></div>\n<p><script type=\"text/javascript\">                    var divElement = document.getElementById('viz1571169397157');                    var vizElement = divElement.getElementsByTagName('object')[0];                    vizElement.style.width='1000px';vizElement.style.height='827px';                    var scriptElement = document.createElement('script');                    scriptElement.src = 'https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js';                    vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement);                </script></p>\n<p>Revenues have steadily increased from 2011-12 (average annual growth of 4.3 percent). In 2018-19, these revenues exceeded prior year actual receipts by $420.6 million or 7.2 percent.</p>\n<p>Not only did Property Tax, Sales Tax, Business Tax, and Transient Occupancy Tax achieve all-time highs, the year-over-year growth percentage in these categories trended higher as well. Property Tax growth percentage increased from 2.4 percent to 7.4 percent in the current year. Sales Tax receipts grew by 9.8 percent compared to 1.8 percent increase in 2017-18. Business Tax continued its steady rise with 8.8 percent increase in 2018-19, compared to 5 percent increase last fiscal year, and 3.6 percent in 2016-17. Transient Occupancy Tax revenue was the exception among the major taxes, with 6.6 percent growth compared to 12.6 percent in 2017-18.</p>\n<p>Documentary Transfer Tax receipts, considered the most volatile of the General Fund taxes, recorded robust growth in the aftermath of the economic recession as property values recovered and sales accelerated, increasing by a total of 134 percent between 2009 and 2015. Since then, receipts have grown only 4.8 percent, and have actually decreased slightly over the past two years. Since Documentary Transfer Tax is a transaction-based tax, both prices and volume must increase for significant gains. For the past two years, prices have continued to rise but declining sales volume has pulled down tax receipts.</p>\n<p>In past years, a drop in Documentary Transfer Tax receipts has served as a leading indicator of an imminent recession. Since it was established in the early 1990s, it has dropped four times. Each of the first three drops preceded periods of overall economic contraction. It remains to be seen whether the slight declines of 2018 and 2019 repeat this pattern.</p>\n<p><strong><u>Appropriations, Expenditures &amp; Encumbrances</u></strong></p>\n<p>Total expenditures, including encumbrances, were $8.84 billion. This was $331.3 million or 3.9 percent higher than the 2017-18, but $1.06 billion or 10.7 percent lower than the Adopted Budget.</p>\n<p>Exhibit 5 below presents a comparison between the Adopted Budget, the final budget (which includes interim appropriations made during the year), and actual expenditures and encumbrances by fiscal year.</p>\n<div id=\"viz1571169415338\" class=\"tableauPlaceholder\" style=\"position: relative; width: 100%; height: 727px; overflow: hidden; display: block;\"><noscript><a href='#'><img alt=' ' src='https://public.tableau.com/static/images/PF/PFR_2019Exhibit5/Dashboard1/1_rss.png' style='border: none' /></a></noscript><script src=\"https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js\"></script><object class=\"tableauViz\" style=\"display: none; width: 100%; height: 727px;\" width=\"300\" height=\"150\"><param name=\"host_url\" value=\"https%3A%2F%2Fpublic.tableau.com%2F\"><param name=\"embed_code_version\" value=\"3\"><param name=\"site_root\" value=\"\"><param name=\"name\" value=\"PFR_2019Exhibit5/Dashboard1\"><param name=\"tabs\" value=\"no\"><param name=\"toolbar\" value=\"yes\"><param name=\"static_image\" value=\"https://public.tableau.com/static/images/PF/PFR_2019Exhibit5/Dashboard1/1.png\"><param name=\"animate_transition\" value=\"yes\"><param name=\"display_static_image\" value=\"yes\"><param name=\"display_spinner\" value=\"yes\"><param name=\"display_overlay\" value=\"yes\"><param name=\"display_count\" value=\"yes\"></object><div style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;right:0;bottom:0;border:0;padding:0;margin:0\"><div style=\"top:100px;left:0;right:0;position:absolute;z-index:991;box-shadow:none;display:flex;justify-content:center;\"><style>#tableau-svg-spinner-container-4{width:65px;height:65px;border-radius:10px;display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center}#tableau-svg-spinner-4{width:50px;height:50px;-webkit-animation:tableau-svg-spinner-animation 1s linear infinite;animation:tableau-svg-spinner-animation 1s linear infinite}@-webkit-keyframes tableau-svg-spinner-animation{100%{-webkit-transform:rotate(360deg)}}@keyframes tableau-svg-spinner-animation{100%{transform:rotate(360deg)}}</style><div id=\"tableau-svg-spinner-container-4\"><svg id=\"tableau-svg-spinner-4\" viewBox=\"0 0 50 50\"><style>#tail{fill:url(#tableau-fade-4)}#head{fill:#616570}stop{stop-color:#616570}</style><linearGradient id=\"tableau-fade-4\" x2=\"50\" y1=\"25\" y2=\"25\" gradientUnits=\"userSpaceOnUse\"><stop offset=\"0\" stop-opacity=\"0\"></stop><stop offset=\".15\" stop-opacity=\".04\"></stop><stop offset=\".3\" stop-opacity=\".16\"></stop><stop offset=\".45\" stop-opacity=\".36\"></stop><stop offset=\".61\" stop-opacity=\".64\"></stop><stop offset=\".76\"></stop></linearGradient><path id=\"head\" d=\"M0 25a25 25 0 1 0 50 0h-3.9a21.1 21.1 0 1 1-42.2 0\"></path><path id=\"tail\" d=\"M50 25a25 25 0 0 0-50 0h3.9a21.1 21.1 0 1 1 42.2 0\"></path></svg></div></div><div style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;right:0;bottom:0;z-index:990;background-color:#EBEBEB;opacity:.24\"></div><style>#tableau-svg-spinner-container-4{border-radius:12px;background:rgba(255,255,255,.6);</style><div style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; right: 0; bottom: 0; background: transparent url('https://public.tableau.com/static/images/PF/PFR_2019Exhibit5/Dashboard1/1.png?height=0&amp;width=0&amp;deviceScaleFactor=1') no-repeat scroll 0 0; background-size: 0px 0px; box-shadow: none; left:0px; top:1px\"></div></div><iframe frameborder=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" title=\"데이터 비주얼리제이션\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" class=\"tableauViz\" style=\"display: block; width: 100%; height: 727px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: none;\" width=\"300\" height=\"150\"></iframe></div>\n<p><script type=\"text/javascript\">                    var divElement = document.getElementById('viz1571169415338');                    var vizElement = divElement.getElementsByTagName('object')[0];                    if ( divElement.offsetWidth > 800 ) { vizElement.style.width='1000px';vizElement.style.height='827px';} else if ( divElement.offsetWidth > 500 ) { vizElement.style.width='1000px';vizElement.style.height='827px';} else { vizElement.style.width='100%';vizElement.style.height='727px';}                     var scriptElement = document.createElement('script');                    scriptElement.src = 'https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js';                    vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement);                </script></p>\n<p>For the last five years total actual Expenditures and Encumbrances have grown average 4.8 percent.

This would have been higher, but anticipated expenditures from pending labor agreements did not materialize in the current year due to the timing of execution of those agreements. Due to the retroactive nature of some of those agreements, the impact anticipated in 2018-19 will be added to 2019-20 salary growth.</p>\n<p>Total contributions to Library and Recreation and Parks, which increased by a $10.7 million or 6.4 percent and $11.1 million or 5.8 percent respectively, are made pursuant to Charter requirements and are tied to growth in the City’s total assessed valuation.</p>\n<p>Capital Improvement Expenditure Program (CIEP) expenditures were 56.2 percent or $224.5 million lower than budget, and $102.4 million lower than last year. The largest variance from last year was in Clean Water System Projects, which was 54.2 percent or $178.8 million lower than the budget and 41 percent or $104.9 million lower than last year.</p>\n<p>Human Resources Benefits expenses were slightly lower than the budget (0.6 percent), but higher by $35.2 million or 5.1 percent compared to last year. The increase was primarily due to increases in Health care subsidies for civilian and sworn employees, by $24.4 million or 5.2 percent, and Worker’s Compensation costs, which increased by $9.8 million or 5.2 percent.</p>\n<p>Exhibit 7 below breaks out expenditures and encumbrances by Governmental Activity.</p>\n<div id=\"viz1571169538689\" class=\"tableauPlaceholder\" style=\"position: relative; width: 100%; height: 727px; overflow: hidden; display: block;\"><noscript><a href='#'><img alt=' ' src='https://public.tableau.com/static/images/PF/PFR_2019Exhibit7Standardbluetones/Dashboard1/1_rss.png' style='border: none' /></a></noscript><script src=\"https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js\"></script><object class=\"tableauViz\" style=\"display: none; width: 100%; height: 727px;\" width=\"300\" height=\"150\"><param name=\"host_url\" value=\"https%3A%2F%2Fpublic.tableau.com%2F\"><param name=\"embed_code_version\" value=\"3\"><param name=\"site_root\" value=\"\"><param name=\"name\" value=\"PFR_2019Exhibit7Standardbluetones/Dashboard1\"><param name=\"tabs\" value=\"no\"><param name=\"toolbar\" value=\"yes\"><param name=\"static_image\" value=\"https://public.tableau.com/static/images/PF/PFR_2019Exhibit7Standardbluetones/Dashboard1/1.png\"><param name=\"animate_transition\" value=\"yes\"><param name=\"display_static_image\" value=\"yes\"><param name=\"display_spinner\" value=\"yes\"><param name=\"display_overlay\" value=\"yes\"><param name=\"display_count\" value=\"yes\"></object><div style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;right:0;bottom:0;border:0;padding:0;margin:0\"><div style=\"top:100px;left:0;right:0;position:absolute;z-index:991;box-shadow:none;display:flex;justify-content:center;\"><style>#tableau-svg-spinner-container-5{width:65px;height:65px;border-radius:10px;display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center}#tableau-svg-spinner-5{width:50px;height:50px;-webkit-animation:tableau-svg-spinner-animation 1s linear infinite;animation:tableau-svg-spinner-animation 1s linear infinite}@-webkit-keyframes tableau-svg-spinner-animation{100%{-webkit-transform:rotate(360deg)}}@keyframes tableau-svg-spinner-animation{100%{transform:rotate(360deg)}}</style><div id=\"tableau-svg-spinner-container-5\"><svg id=\"tableau-svg-spinner-5\" viewBox=\"0 0 50 50\"><style>#tail{fill:url(#tableau-fade-5)}#head{fill:#616570}stop{stop-color:#616570}</style><linearGradient id=\"tableau-fade-5\" x2=\"50\" y1=\"25\" y2=\"25\" gradientUnits=\"userSpaceOnUse\"><stop offset=\"0\" stop-opacity=\"0\"></stop><stop offset=\".15\" stop-opacity=\".04\"></stop><stop offset=\".3\" stop-opacity=\".16\"></stop><stop offset=\".45\" stop-opacity=\".36\"></stop><stop offset=\".61\" stop-opacity=\".64\"></stop><stop offset=\".76\"></stop></linearGradient><path id=\"head\" d=\"M0 25a25 25 0 1 0 50 0h-3.9a21.1 21.1 0 1 1-42.2 0\"></path><path id=\"tail\" d=\"M50 25a25 25 0 0 0-50 0h3.9a21.1 21.1 0 1 1 42.2 0\"></path></svg></div></div><div style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;right:0;bottom:0;z-index:990;background-color:#EBEBEB;opacity:.24\"></div><style>#tableau-svg-spinner-container-5{border-radius:12px;background:rgba(255,255,255,.6);</style><div style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; right: 0; bottom: 0; background: transparent url('https://public.tableau.com/static/images/PF/PFR_2019Exhibit7Standardbluetones/Dashboard1/1.png?height=0&amp;width=0&amp;deviceScaleFactor=1') no-repeat scroll 0 0; background-size: 0px 0px; box-shadow: none; left:0px; top:1px\"></div></div><iframe frameborder=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" title=\"데이터 비주얼리제이션\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" class=\"tableauViz\" style=\"display: block; width: 100%; height: 727px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: none;\" width=\"300\" height=\"150\"></iframe></div>\n<p><script type=\"text/javascript\">                    var divElement = document.getElementById('viz1571169538689');                    var vizElement = divElement.getElementsByTagName('object')[0];                    if ( divElement.offsetWidth > 800 ) { vizElement.style.width='1000px';vizElement.style.height='827px';} else if ( divElement.offsetWidth > 500 ) { vizElement.style.width='1000px';vizElement.style.height='827px';} else { vizElement.style.width='100%';vizElement.style.height='727px';}                     var scriptElement = document.createElement('script');                    scriptElement.src = 'https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js';                    vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement);                </script></p>\n<p>Almost a third of total expenditures were spent on Protection of Persons and Property. Even as priorities have shifted and the economy has grown, this percentage has remained remarkably stable.</p>\n<p>Also of note were the contributions to the City’s pension systems, which totaled $1.3 billion, 15% of total spending. This is down slightly from recent years, but still a figure that should be monitored carefully.</p>\n<p>The City ended the fiscal year with a total of $617.9 million in encumbrances: $543.4 million in the General Fund and $74.5 million in special funds. $215.9 million was encumbered for salaries to be paid in July 2019, with the balance encumbered in expense, equipment, and special fund project accounts.</p>\n<p>Encumbered funds for salaries are earmarked for the last pay period of the fiscal year and unspent funds are immediately released after payroll is made. Funds encumbered for expense accounts are continued across fiscal years to ensure that cash is available to cover the expenditure when it is made. Schedule V provides a listing of General Fund encumbrances by department.</p>\n<p>The General Fund Encumbrance Policy provides that encumbered funds that remain unspent for a period longer than one fiscal year shall be disencumbered every fiscal year, with the exception of capital project funds. Prior-year encumbrances are automatically disencumbered unless exempted by Mayor and Council approval. As part of the 2018-19 Year-End Financial Status Report, a total of $38.9 million was exempted from disencumbrances, a decrease of $6.0 million from last year’s exemptions.</p>\n<p>Unencumbered General funds revert to the Reserve Fund at year end. As such, exemptions to the automatic disencumbrance policy reduce reversions, thereby reducing the cash available in the Reserve Fund to pay for emergencies and contingencies.

This was $3.1 million less than the amount anticipated in the 2019-20 Adopted Budget. The Reserve Fund cash balance is adjusted by the following factors to arrive at the year-end balance:</p>\n<p><u>a. Balance Before Year-End Reversions/Borrowings</u></p>\n<p>The amount of cash available in the Contingency Reserve prior to adjustments for year-end reversions, unallocated revenues, and borrowings. It does not include cash in the Emergency Reserve.</p>\n<p>For 2018-19, this amount was lower than anticipated in the budget due to higher than anticipated advances to other funds made after the adoption of the budget.</p>\n<p><u>b. Reversion of Uncommitted Balances</u></p>\n<p>Uncommitted General Fund appropriations are reverted to the Reserve Fund at fiscal year-end. Appropriations (spending authority) granted to City departments by the Mayor and Council are committed throughout the year in the form of encumbrances and expenditures. Remaining or uncommitted balances are reverted to the Reserve Fund to the extent they are supported by cash.</p>\n<p>In 2018-19, the budget estimated $158.4 million in reversions. The uncommitted balance at year end was $218.1 million. Excluding unfunded appropriations, a total of $209.3 million reverted prior to reappropriations.</p>\n<p>For a detailed breakdown of uncommitted balances by department, please see Schedule VII.</p>\n<p><u>c. Unallocated Revenue (Excess Receipts)</u></p>\n<p>Unallocated revenue occurs when revenues exceed the total budget appropriation. While the Adopted Budget assumed $12 million in surplus receipts would revert to the Reserve Fund in 2018-19, none were realized, resulting in a reduction of the Reserve Fund balance.</p>\n<p><u>d. Advances Under CF 18-0600-S166</u></p>\n<p>Council File 18-0600-S166 authorized the Controller to borrow from the Reserve Fund at year-end to balance departmental budgets where needed in order to facilitate the closing of the City’s General Ledger. The Controller is authorized to increase appropriations within established limits without getting itemized Mayor and Council approval, a process that would delay the closing of the City’s General Ledger. Advances totaling $353,300 were made for the Fire and General Services departments.</p>\n<p><u>e. Advances Under Charter Section 261(i) for Unfunded Encumbrances and Expenditures</u></p>\n<p>Under Charter Section 261(i), the Controller transfers funds from the Reserve Fund as a loan to any fund that becomes depleted due to tardy receipt of revenue. The 2019-20 Adopted Budget estimated $50.0 million in year-end advances. Actual advances were $61.7 million, consisting of $30.9 million in unfunded expenditures and $30.8 million in unfunded encumbrances (see Schedule VIII for a breakdown by department).</p>\n<p>Unfunded expenditures generally occur when expenditures occur prior to receipts (e.g. grants on reimbursement basis) and/or due to billing delays. When the funding source reimburses the costs, departments are able to repay the advances. If funding is not available, departments may request Mayor and Council approval to write-off the advances. Unfunded encumbered amounts represent a technical adjustment at year-end and are reversed at the start of the new fiscal year as documented in item (f), below.</p>\n<p><strong><u>Reserve Fund Cash Balance (2019-20 Year-Start)</u></strong></p>\n<p>The 2018-19 year-end Reserve Fund cash balance is not the same as the 2019-20 year-start cash balance. The following technical adjustments are made after the close of the prior fiscal year.</p>\n<p><u>f. Return of Advances for Unfunded Encumbrances</u></p>\n<p>Advances for unfunded encumbrances are reversed at the start of the following fiscal year, as discussed in item (e), above.</p>\n<p><u>g. Transfer to Budget</u></p>\n<p>The 2019-20 Adopted Budget included an appropriation to the Reserve Fund totaling $7,639,914.</p>\n<p><u>h. Reappropriations</u></p>\n<p>The 2019-20 Adopted Budget and other Council actions (C.F. 18-0600-S169, 14-1499-S7, 14-1499-S8, 19-0600-S89, 19-0600-S156 and 19-0609) provided that certain uncommitted balances earmarked for specific programs would be reappropriated in the subsequent year if not expended by the year-end. See Schedule VII for reappropriations by department.</p>\n<p>Actual reappropriations of $152.8 million were $29.3 million above the $123.5 million budget, due primarily to unbudgeted reappropriations for housing and homeless services.</p>\n<p><u>i. Transfer to Budget Stabilization Fund </u></p>\n<p>The 2019-20 Adopted Budget transferred $7.0 million into the Budget Stabilization Fund.</p>\n<p></p></div></div><a id=\"bg-showmore-action-6399f17602de78018879392\" class=\"bg-showmore-plg-link bg-   \" style=\"color:#52A2F3;; \" href=\"#\">Read More</a>\n</div><div id=\"budgetstabilizationfund\" class=\"main-content-text-to-spacer\"><h1><strong>Section III: Budget Stabilization Fund</strong></h1>\n<p>The Budget Stabilization Fund (BSF) was added to the City’s Charter in 2011.

However, not once has this budgetary transfer been equal to the amount of “economically sensitive” revenue growth above the 3.4 percent threshold. Instead, the BSF Policy has been met by using the available revenue to meet or exceed the CIEP Policy, as specifically allowed in the BSF Policy.</p>\n<p>While this action is clearly consistent with the specific language in the Policy, this trend has a muting effect on the BSF and, should a time come when budget stabilization is necessary, there will not be sufficient funds in the BSF to meet that need. 25 percent of the current available balance, the Policy’s limit on annual withdrawals, would only provide $28.6 million, less than 0.5 percent of the annual budget.</p>\n<p>Consistent with this Office’s recommendation in the 2018-19 Preliminary Financial Report, the Mayor’s Proposed Budget and the Council’s Budget Resolution instructed the City Attorney to present an ordinance revising the BSF Policy threshold. Concurrently, the City Administrative Officer is developing a revised set of policies for managing the BSF which will hopefully make compliance with the Policy easier while ensuring sufficient monies are in the Fund when the City needs them.</p>\n<p></p></div></div><a id=\"bg-showmore-action-6399f17602f4b8086596874\" class=\"bg-showmore-plg-link bg-   \" style=\"color:#52A2F3;; \" href=\"#\">Read More</a>\n</div><div id=\"bondedindebtedness\" class=\"main-content-text-to-spacer\"><h1><strong>Section IV: Bonded Indebtedness</strong></h1>\n<p>The City’s Debt Management Policy establishes guidelines for the structure and management of the City’s debt obligations.

The ratio increased because the City issued Series 2018-A General Obligation Bonds, providing fund in the amount of $276 million for Proposition HHH Housing and Homeless Facilities projects. This increase reversed a significant long term trend, as the past ten years have seen the City refinance the vast majority of its debt portfolio while not authorizing any new general obligation bonds. As shown on Schedule IX, Statement of General Obligation Bonded Debt, City refunded $53 million and defeased (paid off) $42.3 million during the year.</p>\n<p>Exhibit 12 shows very clearly the responsibility the City has exhibited when it comes to debt management. Consistently falling debt service obligations have put the City in a position to consider major projects, as well as making strategic financing agreements available when these present financial advantages.</p>\n<p>This significant amount of debt capacity also indicates an opportunity to invest in large-scale long-term infrastructure projects, including information technology (IT) infrastructure modernization, as identified in the Controller’s Information Technology Disaster Preparedness, Recovery, and Continuity audit. IT systems perform an increasingly critical role in the City’s every day and public safety operations, and the audit emphasized the immediate need for new investments in IT infrastructure.</p>\n<p></p></div></div><a id=\"bg-showmore-action-6399f176031251029497035\" class=\"bg-showmore-plg-link bg-   \" style=\"color:#52A2F3;; \" href=\"#\">Read More</a>\n</div><div

Tourism and hospitality, professional and business services, direct international trade, entertainment including motion picture and television production, and wholesale trade and logistics all contribute significantly to local employment.&nbsp;Emerging industries are largely technology driven, and include biomedical, digital information technology, environmental technology, and aerospace. More established components of the local industry include apparel, computer and electronic components, transportation equipment, fabricated metal and food processing.</p>\n<h2><strong>City Organization</strong></h2>\n<p>The City operates under a Mayor-Council form of government. The Mayor supervises the administrative processes of the City and works with Council in matters relating to legislation, budget, and finance. The 15-member Council enacts ordinances, levies taxes, authorizes contracts and public improvements, adopts zoning and other land use contracts, and provides necessary resources for the budgetary departments and offices of the City. The City Attorney and City Controller are independently elected.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://lacontroller.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/LAOrgChart7-1-18.pdf\">The City has 38 departments, bureaus, commissions, and offices</a> for which operating funds are annually budgeted by the Council. The Department of Water and Power (DWP), Harbor Department, and the Department of Airports are under the control of boards appointed by the Mayor and confirmed by the Council.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"vc_tta-panel\" id=\"1551911101900-d40819b2-02e8\" data-vc-content=\".vc_tta-panel-body\"><div class=\"vc_tta-panel-heading\"><h4 class=\"vc_tta-panel-title\"><a href=\"#1551911101900-d40819b2-02e8\" data-vc-accordion=\"\" data-vc-container=\".vc_tta-container\"><span class=\"vc_tta-title-text\">General Fund</span></a></h4></div><div class=\"vc_tta-panel-body\"><h1>General Fund<br>\n<a href=\"https://lacontroller.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/financial-report-revenue-icon.png\"><img class=\"size-thumbnail wp-image-487 alignleft\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20150%20150'%3E%3C/svg%3E\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" data-lazy-srcset=\"https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/lacontroller-2b7de.appspot.com/o/photos%2F2022%2Ffinancial-report-revenue-icon-150x150.png?alt=media&token=caae59b4-4bbe-4650-9a48-bdebeff1d91d\" 150w, https://lacontroller.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/financial-report-revenue-icon-81x81.png 81w, https://lacontroller.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/financial-report-revenue-icon.png 216w\" data-lazy-sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/lacontroller-2b7de.appspot.com/o/photos%2F2022%2Ffinancial-report-revenue-icon-150x150.png?alt=media&token=caae59b4-4bbe-4650-9a48-bdebeff1d91d\"><noscript><img class=\"size-thumbnail wp-image-487 alignleft\" src=\"https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/lacontroller-2b7de.appspot.com/o/photos%2F2022%2Ffinancial-report-revenue-icon-150x150.png?alt=media&token=caae59b4-4bbe-4650-9a48-bdebeff1d91d\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" srcset=\"https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/lacontroller-2b7de.appspot.com/o/photos%2F2022%2Ffinancial-report-revenue-icon-150x150.png?alt=media&token=caae59b4-4bbe-4650-9a48-bdebeff1d91d\" 150w, https://lacontroller.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/financial-report-revenue-icon-81x81.png 81w, https://lacontroller.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/financial-report-revenue-icon.png 216w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" /></noscript></a></h1>\n<p>The&nbsp;<strong>General Fund</strong>&nbsp;is the general operating fund of the City and includes transactions of the Reserve Fund and other accounts that have General Fund type activity for generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) reporting purposes.

Decreases in expenses were attributed to decreases in the general government of&nbsp;$100.6&nbsp;million, protection of persons and property of&nbsp;$136.5&nbsp;million, transportation of&nbsp;$2.6million and community development of&nbsp;$29.1&nbsp;million offset by an increase of&nbsp;$217.9&nbsp;million in public works, health and sanitation, and cultural and recreational services. Interest on long-term debt posted an increase of&nbsp;$3.6&nbsp;million.</p>\n<p><strong>Business-type Activities</strong><br>\nThe $7.6 billion combined operating revenues of the City’s six business-type activities were&nbsp;$1.6&nbsp;billion more than the&nbsp;$6.0billion combined operating costs.</p>\n<h2><strong> Fiscal Year 2018 Revenues: $16.0 billion</strong></h2>\n<p>Chart values in thousands of dollars.

    "textofpage": "2018 Preliminary Financial Report\nA first look at the City’s financial performance in the fiscal year ending June 30, 2018\n\n \n\nIn May 2017, the City Council approved a budget of $9.29 billion for the fiscal year from July 1, 2017 through June 30, 2018.\n\nThe Preliminary Financial Report provides data and analysis of the City’s revenues and expenditures for the 2017-18 fiscal year. It details where the City’s budgeted funds came from and how they were spent, in addition to information about the City’s debt, reserves and more.\n\nTo learn more, you can read the report, explore the data through our interactive data visualizations, or download the data and take a look for yourself.\n\nThe Report\n\nOne of the City Controller’s main responsibilities is to analyze and report on the City’s finances. The reports produced by the Controller serve to inform City officials and the general public about the City’s financial activities and financial status. They also aim to initiate meaningful reflection and debate about the City’s fiscal management.\n\nThe Preliminary Financial Report, made available each fall after the City’s books are closed, is the first of these reports. It provides information on how the City spent its funds over the past fiscal year, featuring data and analysis regarding the City’s revenues and expenditures, the Reserve Fund, the Budget Stabilization Fund, and the City’s bonded indebtedness.\n\nMore complete and detailed information, presented in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Practices (GAAP), will be published in the Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (CAFR) later this year.\n\nData Visualizations\nRevenues\n\nDuring the 2017-18 fiscal year, revenue grew by 3.4% in the General Fund and 4.1% in budgeted special funds. This was led by all-time high receipts from Property Tax, Business Tax, Sales Tax, and Transient Occupancy Tax. Combining General Fund and Special Fund revenue, total revenue increased by 3.6% over 2016-17.\n\nView our interactive data visualization to explore the relative size of the City’s revenue sources and their growth over the past ten years.\n\nExpenditures\n\nTotal expenditures grew as well, at a rate of 3.6%, due in large part to salaries and benefits, which accounted for $218 million of the $294 million increase in total expenditures. Expenditures are projected to continue growing at the current pace or more, with open employment contracts for many City employees as well as projected increases in health care costs and retirement contributions.\n\nOur interactive data visualization compares the expenditures of the City’s different departments, as well as non-departmental expenditures, over the past ten years. View total expenditures, salaries, other expenditures, descriptions of each item, and the change of each item over time.\n\nReserve Fund and Budget Stabilization Fund\n\nIt is crucial that the City build up reserve funds during years of strong growth in order to prepare for future downturns. In the last ten fiscal years, with a combination of strong revenue growth and fiscal restraint, the City’s combined reserves (the Reserve Fund and the Budget Stabilization Fund) rose from 3.4% to its 9.4% peak in 2015-16, but has since declined to 7.2% of the 2018-19 Adopted General Fund Budget.\n\nReserve Fund\n\nThe Reserve Fund is established to ensure that funds are available for unanticipated expenditures and revenue shortfalls in the General Fund. The City’s Reserve Fund Policy sets a goal for the Reserve Fund of at least 5% of the General Fund budget every year.\n\nOn July 1, 2018, the Reserve Fund had a balance of $345.8 million, 5.59% of the 2018-2019 budget General Fund revenue and $36.2 million above the 5% the Reserve Fund Policy goal.\n\nBudget Stabilization Fund\n\nThe Budget Stabilization Fund (BSF) was added to the City Charter in 2011. The purpose of the BSF is to set aside funds when revenue projections are exceeded to help smooth out years when revenue is stagnant or is in decline. In the fiscal year 2018, the BSF grew slightly to $96.4 million but stayed about flat as a percentage of General Fund revenues. For the 2019 fiscal year, the adopted budget set aside $9 million to be deposited into the BSF.\n\nClick the chart below to view the performance of the Reserve Fund and Budget Stabilization Fund, both in dollar terms and as a percentage of budgeted General Fund revenues. You can also download the data in the Data section below.\n\nDebt\n\nThe City’s Debt Management Policy establishes guidelines for the structure and management of the City’s debt obligations. These guidelines include a non-voter-approved debt service cap of 6% and a total debt service cap of 15% as a percent of General Fund revenues.\n\nThe City’s total indebtedness and debt service obligations have been on a downward trend since the fiscal year 2012, reflecting lack of any new General Obligation Bond (GOB) issuances and the refinancing of higher rate bonds at the prevailing low-interest rates.

    "textofpage": "Idle Funds\nUntapped Resources: Controller Identifies $28 Million in Unspent Public Funds\n\n \n\nThe City’s treasury is made up of 830 individual special purpose funds (special funds) as of March 2018, in addition to its General Fund. These special funds were each created with very specific restrictions and collectively maintained a balance of $8.7 billion as of June 30, 2017, constituting 90 percent of the City’s overall treasury. Some of the funds are restricted based on legal or grant requirements; other uses are guided (or restricted) by various policy decisions. The result has been a fragmentation of our City’s funds, making it difficult in some instances for funds to be spent.\n\nThis report zeroes in on a specific area of concern that directly affects Angelenos across multiple categories: $28.2 million that has remained unspent for public safety, economic development and more.\n\nMy office has studied and reported on the opportunities and challenges of so many special funds. Since issuing our first report in 2014, we have worked with many City Departments and City Council members to close almost 200 funds. Over the same period, the City created another 157 special funds. It is a priority for my office to examine how each and every special fund was created, how they are managed and the extent to which they are being used – or not – for much-needed City purposes.\n\nThese funds have been idle for a minimum of four years, with some funds unexpended for more than 10 years. This funding could be used for much needed public services such as street improvements, economic development and public safety services. We have identified idle funds and associated funding amounts, in the following categories:\n\nExceedingly restrictive accounts, such as fund number 864, entitled, “Venice Coastal Parking Impact Fund,” which can only be used for parking improvements in a three square block section of Venice. The fund has $978,584 and has not been tapped in at least six years;\nDivergent uses, such as fund number 911, entitled, “Channel Gateway/Venice Affordable Housing,” which was originally authorized in 2000 and still has $452,757. The source of the funds was a one-time $1 million payment from a developer and its eligible uses are for affordable housing in Venice or operations of a beach shuttle;\nPrograms no longer active, such as a number of Business Improvement Districts from Reseda to Downtown, L.A. that still have $202,157 spread across five accounts;\nLegacy accounts, such as fund number 44H, entitled, “Calworks Youth Jobs Trust.” This account was authorized by the City Council in 2000 for a five-year grant, but sits with $181,501 for economic development;\nExpired grants, such as fund number 311, entitled, “Fifth Year Economic Planning Grant,” which was authorized in 1987 for a one-time grant program still has $43,564 in the account. The grant no longer exists but the fund remains active.\n\nThere is a crucial imperative for the City to update and reform its management and use of special funds. This report highlights 123 idle funds, with a total cash balance of $28 million, from which there have been no expenditures over a period of three years. While 17 of these funds have no current cash balance, 31 contain more than $100,000 and 7 hold more than $1,000,000. These funds are administered by 18 different departments, with the Mayor’s Office, Economic and Workforce Development (EWDD), and the City Clerk administering the largest numbers of funds.\n\nThis funding could be used for much needed public services such as street improvements, economic development and public safety services. We have identified idle funds and associated funding amounts, in the following categories:\n\nStreet Improvements: $7.6 million in 13 funds\nParks: $7.6 million in eight funds\nAffordable Housing: $5.1 million in six funds\nEconomic Development: $3.9 million in 33 funds\nPublic Safety: $2.5 million in 27 funds\nPublic Works: $762,000 in seven funds\nSocial Services: $449,000 in 10 funds\nArts: $229,000 in two funds",

    "textofpage": "2017 Preliminary Financial Report\nA first look at the City’s financial performance in the fiscal year ending June 30, 2017\n\n \n\nIn May 2016, the City Council approved a budget of $8.8 billion for the fiscal year from July 1, 2016 through June 30, 2017.\n\nThe Preliminary Financial Report provides data and analysis of the City’s revenues and expenditures for the 2016-17 fiscal year. It details where the City’s budgeted funds came from and how they were spent, in addition to information about the City’s debt, reserves, and more.\n\nTo learn more, you can read the report, explore the data through our interactive data visualizations, or download the data and take a look for yourself.\n\nThe Report\n\nOne of the City Controller’s main responsibilities is to analyze and report on the City’s finances. The reports produced by the Controller serve to inform City officials and the general public about the City’s financial activities and financial status. They also aim to initiate meaningful reflection and debate about the City’s fiscal management.\n\nThe Preliminary Financial Report, made available each fall after the City’s books are closed, is the first of these reports. It provides information on how the City spent its funds over the past fiscal year, featuring data and analysis regarding the City’s revenues and expenditures, the Reserve Fund, the Budget Stabilization Fund, and the City’s bonded indebtedness.\n\nMore complete and detailed information, presented in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Practices (GAAP), will be published in the Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (CAFR) later this year. The Controller also publishes the Community Financial Report, which aims to make the information in the CAFR more accessible to the general public.\n\nData\nRevenues\n\nIn fiscal year 2017, the City’s General Fund revenues grew by 6% compared to the previous year. Budgeted Special Fund revenues grew by 3.6%. This 4% overall growth was led by all-time highs in Property Tax, Business Tax, Sales Tax, Transient Occupancy Tax, and building permit fees.\n\nView our interactive data visualization to explore the relative size of the City’s revenue sources and their growth over the past ten years.\n\n \n\nExpenditures\n\nThe City’s expenditures grew by 5.2% in fiscal year 2017. This was due in large part to salary increases and a spike in payouts for legal settlements and decisions. City employee health benefit subsidies increased by 6.4%, compared to a nationwide average of more than 20%. Additionally, the City’s debt service fell to its lowest annual total since 2004.\n\nOur interactive data visualization compares the expenditures of the City’s different departments, as well as non-departmental expenditures, over the past ten years. View total expenditures, salaries, other expenditures, descriptions of each item, and the change of each item over time.\n\n \n\nReserve Fund and Budget Stabilization Fund\n\nIt is crucial that the City build up reserve funds during years of strong growth in order to prepare for future downturns. From 2009 to 2015, the City built its reserves (including the Reserve Fund and the Budget Stabilization Fund) up to almost 10% of the adopted General Fund Budget, up from 3.4%. Since then, the reserves have fallen to less than 8% of the General Fund.\n\n \n\nReserve Fund\n\nThe Reserve Fund is established to ensure that funds are available for unanticipated expenditures and revenue shortfalls in the General Fund. The City’s Reserve Fund Policy states that the Reserve Fund should be maintained at 5% of the General Fund budget. On July 1, 2017, the Reserve Fund had a cash balance of $354.5 million, 6.08% of 2017-18 budgeted General Fund revenue.\n\n \n\nBudget Stabilization Fund\n\nThe Budget Stabilization Fund (BSF) was added to the City Charter in 2011. The purpose of the BSF is to set aside funds when revenue projections are exceeded to help smooth out years when revenue is stagnant or is in decline. In fiscal year 2017, the BSF grew slightly to about $95 million, but stayed about flat as a percentage of General Fund revenues.\n\nClick the chart on the left to view the performance of the Reserve Fund and Budget Stabilization Fund, both in dollar terms and as a percentage of budgeted General Fund revenues. You can also download the data in the Data section below.\n\n \n\nDebt\n\nThe City’s Debt Management Policy establishes guidelines for the structure and management of the City’s debt obligations. These guidelines include a non-voter-approved debt service cap of 6% and a total debt service cap of 15% as a percent of General Fund revenues.\n\nThe City’s total indebtedness and debt service obligations have been on a downward trend since fiscal year 2012, reflecting lack of any new General Obligation Bond (GOB) issuances and the refinancing of higher rate bonds at the prevailing low interest rates. Going forward, the opportunity to lower costs further will be limited, as interest rates will likely begin to rise and the City begins issuing the GOB debt authorized by Measure HHH.
